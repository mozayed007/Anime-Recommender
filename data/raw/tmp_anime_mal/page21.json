The Symphonic Poem originated with the music Isao Tomita wrote for Jungle Emperor in 1965. He re-worked his music into a long form which tells a story by itself. (This form of music was termed \"symphonic poem\" or \"tone poem\" by composers in the late Romantic era.) So music that was written originally to enhance visual story telling became the story teller.\n\nTomita's symphonic poem was recorded in the mid-60s and issued on LP in Japan. More than once, in fact. It has also been on CD more than once.\n\nIn 1991, Tezuka Productions turned the process upside down and created new animation to illustrate the symphonic poem. The story is basically that of the first Kimba episode. We see the peaceful animal kingdom under Panja, the coming of the hunters, Eliza's capture and Panja's death. Kimba is born and escapes back to Africa. All this told without a single word spoken. The style of the Symphonic Poem's animation is unique. It draws heavily on the style of the 1989 TV series, but Kimba looks different from the way he looked in any other production.\n\n(Source: kimbawlion.com)", "mean": 6.4, "rank": 6928, "popularity": 12176, "num_list_users": 1187, "num_scoring_users": 363, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "2012-02-21T17:49:01+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-02-02T03:09:15+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 1991, "season": "spring"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 3060, "rating": "g", "studios": [{"id": 11, "name": "Madhouse"}]}, {"id": 14583, "title": "Rinne no Lagrange Specials", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/39747.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/39747l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Flower declaration of your heart Specials", "Lag-Rin Specials"], "en": "Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne Specials", "ja": "\u8f2a\u5efb\u306e\u30e9\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7"}, "start_date": "2012-03-23", "end_date": "2012-08-24", "synopsis": "Rinne no Lagrange short specials included in the Rinne no Lagrange Blu-rays and DVDs.", "mean": 6.18, "rank": 8036, "popularity": 7656, "num_list_users": 5634, "num_scoring_users": 1854, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}], "created_at": "2012-06-25T19:29:32+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-09-05T21:25:32+00:00", "media_type": "special", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 6, "start_season": {"year": 2012, "season": "winter"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 180, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 27, "name": "Xebec"}]}, {"id": 4088, "title": "Wonder 3", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/33155.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/33155l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["W3", "Wonder Three", "Amazing Three", "Wondering Three"], "en": "The Amazing 3", "ja": "\u30ef\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\uff13"}, "start_date": "1965-06-06", "end_date": "1966-06-27", "synopsis": "Wonder 3 is an Osamu Tezuka manga and a black and white anime series.

The instrument of destruction is a device resembling a large black ball with two antennae that is variously called an anti-proton bomb, a solar bomb, and a neutron bomb. Although the three agents (Captain Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko) are originally humanoid in appearance, upon arrival on Earth they take on the appearances of a rabbit (Bokko), a horse (Nokko), and a duck (Pukko) that they had captured as examples of Earth life forms. While on Earth they travel in a tire-shaped vehicle capable of enormous speeds called the Big Wheel, which can travel on both land and water (and, with modifications, through the air).\n\nThe series tackles a number of issues which were surprisingly progressive for an animated cartoon of that period; particularly ecological concerns and poverty.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "mean": 6.86, "rank": 4624, "popularity": 12271, "num_list_users": 1149, "num_scoring_users": 354, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "created_at": "2008-03-11T01:19:15+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-16T08:11:46+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 52, "start_season": {"year": 1965, "season": "summer"}, "average_episode_duration": 1380, "rating": "g", "studios": [{"id": 68, "name": "Mushi Production"}]}, {"id": 37112, "title": "Doraemon Anniversary 25", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/90052.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/90052l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Doraemon the Movie 25th Anniversary", "ja": "\u30c9\u30e9\u3048\u3082\u3093\u30a2\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc25"}, "start_date": "2004-03-06", "end_date": "2004-03-06", "synopsis": "A short film screened simultaneously with Doraemon Movie 25: Nobita no Wan Nyan Jikuuden and Pa-Pa-Pa the \u2605 Movie: Perman - Tako de Pon!

After discussing with the old beggar, Li Xiaobai understood that young talents are people who serve the country and the people and help the world.\n\nTherefore, Li Xiaobai set up a green channel to encourage everyone to exchange labor for the time limit for bathing. So far, Li Xiaobai has completed the branch line, unlocked the token, and went to the Holy Demon Sect to participate in the entry test.\n\nDuring the test, Li Xiaobai successfully entered the Holy Demon Sect by virtue of the props produced by the system, passing the three levels of body skills, xinxing, and cultivation. Li Xiaobai met his brothers and sisters. Participate in the Zongmen martial arts competition, defeat the masters of other states, and obtain the qualification to go to the secret realm. At this time, Feng Wuxie came to the door suddenly, saying that Li Xiaobai was found by the evil cultivators pretending to be Zhang Rui, and a group of evil cultivators were attacking the Xianyu sect at this time. Everyone returned to the sect together and fought hard against the evil cultivators. At this time, Ou Yezi, the head of the Holy Demon Sect, made a move to help everyone repel the evil cultivators.\n\nLi Xiaobai, who thought he could be free and unrestrained for two days, has no choice but to embark on a trip to the secret place under the continuous urging of the system.\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)", "rank": 15957, "popularity": 16886, "num_list_users": 334, "num_scoring_users": 52, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Martial Arts"}], "created_at": "2022-12-28T07:22:08+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-12-28T12:50:28+00:00", "media_type": "ona", "status": "currently_airing", "num_episodes": 60, "start_season": {"year": 2022, "season": "fall"}, "average_episode_duration": 600, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 2059, "name": "Soyep"}]}, {"id": 2054, "title": "Carol", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1306/103782.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1306/103782l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Carol: A Day In A Girl's Life"], "en": "", "ja": "CAROL"}, "start_date": "1990-03-21", "end_date": "1990-03-21", "synopsis": "Carol is the tale of a teenage girl whose life seems normal enough until she notices music disappearing from all around her, such as the sound of Big Ben, her father`s cello-playing, and the concert of her favorite band, Gaball Screen.

The second episode is about five sisters, only one of whom isn't married. What's more, the cool Kiyomi seems to have no interest whatsoever in finding a husband.

The movie starts when a pink shooting star falls down from the night sky and soughts out a toy store, striking one of the Cure Dolls of Melody on display. The Melody Doll comes alive, freeing herself from her box. Jumping to the floor, she explores the toy store when she hears the noise of a crowd coming from outside. Running out of the store, she discovers a huge TV screen which reflects a \"real-life\" image of herself. Playing around with it, she is soon joined by a Cure Doll of Rhythm.
