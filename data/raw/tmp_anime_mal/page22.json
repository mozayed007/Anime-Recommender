No direct historical connections are identified between the two series, but it can be assumed that the original International Rescue evolved into its 2086 incarnation over those thirty years. The Tracy family are not mentioned in the animated series. In the animated series, the actual team is known as the Thunderbirds, whilst in the original series the name merely referred to their vehicles. The animated series is otherwise very similar to the original, with most episodes revolving around a natural or man-made disaster which the Thunderbirds team must investigate and help resolve. Unlike the original series, Thunderbirds 2086 also has an on-going story arc revolving around a breakaway independence group known as the Shadow Axis, led by the mysterious Star Crusher. There is a heavy intimation in the series that Star Crusher is not human and may be some kind of alien entity.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "mean": 6.09, "rank": 8448, "popularity": 11998, "num_list_users": 1257, "num_scoring_users": 320, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 29, "name": "Space"}], "created_at": "2008-02-20T06:51:29+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-09-23T08:59:53+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 18, "start_season": {"year": 1982, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "saturday", "start_time": "19:30"}, "average_episode_duration": 1520, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 18, "name": "Toei Animation"}]}, {"id": 7041, "title": "Seto no Hanayome OVA Specials", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/22430.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/22430l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Seto no Hanayome OVA Omakes"], "en": "Seto no Hanayome OVA Extras", "ja": "\u702c\u6238\u306e\u82b1\u5ac1 OVA Extras"}, "start_date": "2008-11-03", "end_date": "2009-01-05", "synopsis": "30 seconds sketches/omakes from the OVAs.", "mean": 7.36, "rank": 2266, "popularity": 5511, "num_list_users": 12785, "num_scoring_users": 4950, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}], "created_at": "2009-08-18T23:56:57+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-31T11:30:42+00:00", "media_type": "special", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 2, "start_season": {"year": 2008, "season": "fall"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 40, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 3, "name": "Gonzo"}]}, {"id": 7809, "title": "3-tsu no Kumo", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/18948.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/18948l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Mittsu no Kumo", "3tsu no Kumo", "Trilogy about Clouds"], "en": "Trilogy about Cloud", "ja": "\uff13\u3064\u306e\u96f2"}, "start_date": "2005-08-20", "end_date": "2005-08-20", "synopsis": "Plot Synopsis : Trilogy about clouds, that is, an omnibus movie consisting of three different stories of clouds.

The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation's Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful. \n\nThe rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku's Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history. \n\nWhile this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast. \n\n(Source: Pelleas)", "mean": 6.12, "rank": 8316, "popularity": 11461, "num_list_users": 1520, "num_scoring_users": 449, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}], "created_at": "2009-03-26T16:15:14+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-07T14:32:47+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1471, "start_season": {"year": 1976, "season": "winter"}, "average_episode_duration": 1500, "rating": "g", "studios": [{"id": 86, "name": "Group TAC"}]}, {"id": 42885, "title": "Zoids Wild Senki", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1202/109793.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1202/109793l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30be\u30a4\u30c9\u30ef\u30a4\u30eb\u30c9\u6226\u8a18"}, "start_date": "2020-10-17", "end_date": "2021-03-12", "synopsis": "Battle CG anime based on the Zoids Wild franchise.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "rank": 14494, "popularity": 14173, "num_list_users": 632, "num_scoring_users": 85, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "created_at": "2020-09-15T01:08:12+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-02T14:55:06+00:00", "media_type": "ona", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 6, "start_season": {"year": 2020, "season": "fall"}, "source": "other", "average_episode_duration": 225, "rating": "pg", "studios": [{"id": 28, "name": "OLM"}]}, {"id": 50053, "title": "Humanoid", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1079/118638.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1079/118638l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Humanoid", "ja": "\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9"}, "start_date": "2018-11-06", "end_date": "2018-11-06", "synopsis": "Music video directed and animated by sakiyama for the song Humanoid by ZUTOMAYO.", "mean": 6.47, "popularity": 16141, "num_list_users": 390, "num_scoring_users": 224, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 19, "name": "Music"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "2021-10-08T05:25:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-06T21:16:03+00:00", "media_type": "music", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2018, "season": "fall"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 259, "rating": "g", "studios": []}, {"id": 33414, "title": "Otona no Ikkyuu-san", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/80274.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/80274l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30aa\u30c8\u30ca\u306e\u4e00\u4f11\u3055\u3093"}, "start_date": "2016-06-06", "end_date": "2016-12-28", "synopsis": "An adult comedy series following the life of Ikkyuu, a monk.", "rank": 18868, "popularity": 16012, "num_list_users": 399, "num_scoring_users": 66, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}], "created_at": "2016-06-07T04:22:17+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-11-30T02:19:03+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 13, "start_season": {"year": 2016, "season": "summer"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "wednesday", "start_time": "20:45"}, "average_episode_duration": 300, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": []}, {"id": 36742, "title": "Koisuru Shirokuma Tokubetsu-ban", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/88842.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/88842l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["A Polar Bear in Love", "Hyouheki Don", "Koi Suru Shirokuma", "Ai no Omosa"], "en": "", "ja": "\u604b\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30ed\u30af\u30de \u7279\u5225\u7248"}, "start_date": "2017-11-01", "end_date": "2018-01-31", "synopsis": "Shochiku began streaming a new short for the for the \"petit anime\" of Koisuru Shirokuma.
