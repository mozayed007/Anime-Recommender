Moans of ecstasy and frenzy reverberate across the world from those desperate to seek relief from their relief.\n \nAlthough the streets run white with bodily fluids, people are far from relieved of their sexual troubles; fortunately, it is the perfect time to search for solutions! Inspiration can be found around every corner as encounters with the pollinic beings expose both hidden feelings and alluring physicality. Regardless of the climax that each person reaches, one thing is for sure\u2014no amount of tissues will be enough for this allergy season.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.04, "popularity": 5417, "num_list_users": 13329, "num_scoring_users": 4880, "num_favorites": 83, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "2008-02-17T14:25:37+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-01T22:53:49+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 4, "start_season": {"year": 2008, "season": "winter"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1699, "rating": "rx", "studios": [{"id": 405, "name": "T-Rex"}, {"id": 2333, "name": "Space-X"}]}, {"id": 50532, "title": "Boku no Hero Academia the Movie 3: World Heroes' Mission - Tabidachi", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1935/121274.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1935/121274l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission"], "en": "My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission - Take-off", "ja": "\u50d5\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30a2\u30ab\u30c7\u30df\u30a2 THE MOVIE\u3000\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 \u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba \u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3000\u226a\u65c5\u7acb\u3061\u226b"}, "start_date": "2022-02-16", "end_date": "2022-02-16", "synopsis": "Adaptation of \"No.XXX Hawks: SOOTHE\" side-chapter in the Vol.World Heroes manga which was a special present for movie attendees in Japan and in selected American theaters.

Against a roster full of nationally-ranked players, the former flightless crows will have to use everything in their arsenal if they want to represent Miyagi.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n", "mean": 8.2, "rank": 348, "popularity": 2269, "num_list_users": 78377, "num_scoring_users": 29994, "num_favorites": 74, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 30, "name": "Sports"}, {"id": 77, "name": "Team Sports"}], "created_at": "2017-03-15T07:50:44+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-02-05T19:42:06+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2017, "season": "summer"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 5280, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 10, "name": "Production I.G"}]}, {"id": 1602, "title": "Soukou no Strain", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/75409.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/75409l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Strain: Strategic Armored Infantry", "ja": "\u594f\u5149\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3"}, "start_date": "2006-11-02", "end_date": "2007-02-15", "synopsis": "Eleven-year-old Sara Werec's elder brother, Ralph, was sent to the frontlines of an interstellar war 130 light years away, and Sara vowed to reunite with him one day as a comrade.

But fate is unchangeable, and his desperate attempts to save them can never seem to rewrite the future.\n\nToumei Answer\nShintarou Kisaragi knows how every day will go. Blessed with a photographic memory, he knows he will score full marks on his next exam, and he knows that Ayano Tateyama, the girl who sits next to him, will do poorly. But with his genius also comes unrelenting boredom; not even Ayano's bright smile and optimistic outlook can make him waver. His apathy may finally be broken, however, when Ayano does something that shakes Shintarou to his very core.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.5, "popularity": 6023, "num_list_users": 10248, "num_scoring_users": 4018, "num_favorites": 74, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 19, "name": "Music"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "created_at": "2015-06-07T17:30:01+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-11T03:04:22+00:00", "media_type": "music", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 5, "start_season": {"year": 2012, "season": "spring"}, "source": "music", "average_episode_duration": 249, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": []}, {"id": 13767, "title": "Junjou Romantica OVA", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/60389.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/60389l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Junjyou Romantica OAD", "Junjou Egoist", "Junjou Terrorist", "Junjou Mistake"], "en": "", "ja": "\u7d14\u60c5\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30c1\u30ab"}, "start_date": "2012-12-20", "end_date": "2015-12-01", "synopsis": "OVAs that come with the limited premium edition of volumes 16 and 20 of the manga series.", "mean": 7.7, "rank": 1163, "popularity": 2810, "num_list_users": 53922, "num_scoring_users": 25814, "num_favorites": 74, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}], "created_at": "2012-04-09T11:26:43+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-07T16:35:35+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 2, "start_season": {"year": 2012, "season": "fall"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1365, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 37, "name": "Studio Deen"}]}, {"id": 3791, "title": "Air Gear Special", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1902/97393.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1902/97393l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Air Gear Episode 21.5"], "en": "Air Gear: Special Trick", "ja": "\u30a8\u30a2\u30fb\u30ae\u30a2"}, "start_date": "2007-03-21", "end_date": "2007-03-21", "synopsis": "Takes part a while after Ikki accepts Simca's offer to become the new leader of Genesis.

As a stream of seemingly unrelated events creeps closer to the case of Suzuki's death, Section Nine will have to face its greatest challenge to date, threatening its very existence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n", "mean": 7.27, "rank": 2685, "popularity": 4718, "num_list_users": 18984, "num_scoring_users": 4164, "num_favorites": 71, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 39, "name": "Detective"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "2008-02-03T10:43:27+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-06-15T19:56:01+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 26, "start_season": {"year": 2008, "season": "spring"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1379, "rating": "r+", "studios": [{"id": 11, "name": "Madhouse"}]}, {"id": 27411, "title": "Koukaku Kidoutai: Shin Movie", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/72690.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/72690l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Ghost in the Shell (2015)"], "en": "Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie", "ja": "\u653b\u6bbb\u6a5f\u52d5\u968a \u65b0\u5287\u5834\u7248"}, "start_date": "2015-06-20", "end_date": "2015-06-20", "synopsis": "In the year 2027, a year following the end of the non-nuclear World War IV, a bomb has gone off in Newport City, killing a major arms dealer who may have ties with the mysterious 501 Organization.
