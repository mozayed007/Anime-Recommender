Out of desperation she turns to the message board Free Friends to earn some money. She develops a relationship with her first partner, Kaito, without realizing that they're much more than strangers...\n\nKaito, the newest student teacher at Minatohashi Higashi Academy, has a vice. Unable and unwilling to form meaningful, intimate relationships with other people, he instead satiates his need for intimacy through compensated dating. In order to feed this habit, he uses a message board known as Free Friends. Through its services, he can make the necessary arrangements and appointments with the various girls who also use the site, mainly students running away from home or simply in need of extra income.\n\nHis troubles trace back to a deeply seated complex: a hollow, yearning feeling brought on by the thought and sight of violets. Violets, or \"Sumire\", remind him of the sister he'd been separated from during their childhood when their parents had divorced. Only by losing himself in a woman's body can he rid himself of those clinging, nostalgic feelings.\n\nRight before the school year begins, the mere reminder of the academy's famed violet flowerbeds (despite them not even being in bloom at the time) is enough to drive Kaito to Free Friends. A seemingly routine exchange leaves him completely unprepared for the girl waiting for him: an absolutely stunning beauty by the pseudonym of \"Sumi\".\n\nA few days later, he discovers that \"Sumi\" is not only a student at the exact same school he teaches at, but that her classmates call her \"Sumire\". Incredulous, Kaito checks the school rosters. Surely it's not the same Sumire he knows; surely it's just another girl with the same given name? But as if setting him up for the universe's biggest punchline, the only Sumire at the school is none other than his very own Shinozaki Sumire, the sister his mother had taken away from him. Kaito's dreams of one day reuniting with his sister have in fact already been realized... just not in a way that he ever could have imagined.\n\n(Source: VNDB)", "mean": 6.5, "popularity": 7571, "num_list_users": 5780, "num_scoring_users": 1874, "num_favorites": 7, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "2017-12-01T10:49:21+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-02-19T22:32:39+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 4, "start_season": {"year": 2018, "season": "winter"}, "source": "visual_novel", "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "rx", "studios": [{"id": 365, "name": "PoRO"}]}, {"id": 1549, "title": "1000-nen Joou: Queen Millennia", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/2398.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/2398l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Sennen Joou", "Queen Millennia Movie"], "en": "", "ja": "1000\u5e74\u5973\u738b Queen Millennia"}, "start_date": "1982-03-13", "end_date": "1982-03-13", "synopsis": "AD 1999, the Earth was in a critical situation; a planet Lar Metal was approaching to the Earth.

There's a little disclaimer at the front that says \"This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,\" and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc. \n\nThe \"travel writer\" turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g. visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains). The mangaka doesn't really care about trains; she's cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he's completely gung-ho as long as he's following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining. \n\nThroughout, though, it feels real \u2014if you've travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel\u2014 and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga! \n\nIn addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There's always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there's really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ", "mean": 6.2, "rank": 7929, "popularity": 9869, "num_list_users": 2632, "num_scoring_users": 592, "num_favorites": 7, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "created_at": "2007-05-29T16:44:28+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-11-19T01:49:54+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 13, "start_season": {"year": 2007, "season": "summer"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1470, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 86, "name": "Group TAC"}]}, {"id": 52216, "title": "Twisted-Wonderland 2-shuunen Kinen PV", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1083/124983.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1083/124983l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Twisted-Wonderland 2nd Anniversary PV", "ja": "\u300e\u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30cb\u30fc \u30c4\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30c9\u30ef\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u300f2\u5468\u5e74\u8a18\u5ff5PV"}, "start_date": "2022-03-17", "end_date": "2022-03-17", "synopsis": "As the year progresses, one student of the magical Night Raven College continues to make a record of their campus life.
