Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.\n\nIn due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \"the Metal.\"\n\nThe Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.\n\nHowever, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual's consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.\n\nExperts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.\n\nThis is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.\n\n(Source: Production I.G)", "mean": 7.09, "rank": 3614, "popularity": 4071, "num_list_users": 26448, "num_scoring_users": 6071, "num_favorites": 52, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "created_at": "2007-11-05T20:27:39+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-12-17T14:58:35+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 26, "start_season": {"year": 2008, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "wednesday", "start_time": "00:59"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 1354, "rating": "r", "studios": [{"id": 10, "name": "Production I.G"}]}, {"id": 20033, "title": "Miss Monochrome The Animation", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56165.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56165l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30df\u30b9\u30fb\u30e2\u30ce\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30e0 -The Animation-"}, "start_date": "2013-10-02", "end_date": "2013-12-25", "synopsis": "Miss Monochrome is an android powered by a single AA battery.

As the game progresses and the sexual tension escalates, it culminates in a sexual free-for-all with his stepmother and stepsister. \n\n(Source: Boxtorrents) ", "mean": 6.71, "popularity": 6438, "num_list_users": 8663, "num_scoring_users": 3698, "num_favorites": 49, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "2008-05-27T19:51:05+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-28T14:44:19+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 2, "start_season": {"year": 2007, "season": "summer"}, "source": "visual_novel", "average_episode_duration": 1649, "rating": "rx", "studios": [{"id": 239, "name": "Y.O.U.C"}]}, {"id": 37362, "title": "Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1253/123621.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1253/123621l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode", "ja": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3000\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30bf\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8 -The Third Episode-"}, "start_date": "2018-03-20", "end_date": "2018-03-20", "synopsis": "The short follows a boy looking for a girl he met in the Gun Gale Online game.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "mean": 7.23, "rank": 2929, "popularity": 4771, "num_list_users": 18582, "num_scoring_users": 4354, "num_favorites": 47, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}], "created_at": "2008-09-10T05:04:49+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-03T11:48:04+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 26, "start_season": {"year": 2009, "season": "spring"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1380, "rating": "r+", "studios": [{"id": 11, "name": "Madhouse"}]}, {"id": 32878, "title": "\u0113lDLIVE", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/82348.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/82348l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "elDLIVE", "ja": "\u30a8\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6 \u3010\u0113lDLIVE\u3011"}, "start_date": "2017-01-08", "end_date": "2017-03-26", "synopsis": "Chuuta Kokonose is an orphan who lives with his aunt.
