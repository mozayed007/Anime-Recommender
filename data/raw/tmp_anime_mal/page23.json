Ryoma is an honest and tenderd-hearted boy who hates any sort of violence and brutality. He is so sensitive, and a bit naive, that he often cries from pity when he sees even the simples act of violence such as another kid trampling a tiny insect. The kids and even his family call him a \"cry baby\". However, he is not a coward -- not a \"chicken\" at all. His distress comes from a desire to prevent unreasonable acts and the wrong doings in life.\n\nHis older sister is the only person who understands his depth. She recognizes that her brother is gifted with a special talent and she does her best to protect him and cheer him up.\n\n(Source: Enoki Films USA)", "mean": 7.04, "rank": 3828, "popularity": 13475, "num_list_users": 796, "num_scoring_users": 195, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}], "created_at": "2010-03-17T12:17:14+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-04T11:37:41+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 39, "start_season": {"year": 1992, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "saturday", "start_time": "17:30"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1500, "studios": [{"id": 326, "name": "Animation 21"}]}, {"id": 9951, "title": "Jiu Se Lu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1440/112808.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1440/112808l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["The Nine Colored Deer", "A Deer of Nine Colors"], "en": "", "ja": "\u4e5d\u8272\u9e7f"}, "start_date": "1981", "end_date": "1981", "synopsis": "In ancient times, a Persian merchant gets lost in a windstorm.

It's not intended to be scary in the slightest, but rather, it focuses on the comical and bizarre things Zombie-kun's body can do, and the common-sense-defying way Zombie-kun behaves. For example, he'll take out his stomach and inflate it with air to use as a pillow, or if he gets wet, he'll detach parts of his body and wring them out like towels, then reattach them with a glue stick. Everything is depicted in a cute, cartoony fashion so as not to be too graphic for kids. \n\n(Source: Baka-Updates)", "mean": 5.11, "rank": 11846, "popularity": 15138, "num_list_users": 488, "num_scoring_users": 189, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}], "created_at": "2017-01-26T01:09:44+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-10-31T16:46:55+00:00", "media_type": "ona", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 2, "start_season": {"year": 2017, "season": "winter"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 180, "rating": "pg", "studios": []}, {"id": 35329, "title": "Ultrasonico", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/85083.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/85083l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30bd\u30cb\u30b3"}, "start_date": "2017-04-01", "end_date": "2017-04-01", "synopsis": "2017 April Fools' Day event where Nitro+ mascot Super Sonico is becoming an Ultraman-esque superhero, \"Ultrasonico.\"", "mean": 4.95, "rank": 12109, "popularity": 10534, "num_list_users": 2123, "num_scoring_users": 684, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Super Power"}], "created_at": "2017-03-31T21:57:50+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-03-31T03:51:55+00:00", "media_type": "ona", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2017, "season": "spring"}, "source": "other", "average_episode_duration": 155, "rating": "g", "studios": []}, {"id": 41217, "title": "Pianoman", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1219/106730.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1219/106730l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["PianoMan"], "en": "", "ja": "PIANOMAN"}, "start_date": "2020-01-17", "end_date": "2020-01-17", "synopsis": "The still, white space expands as far as the eye can see.
