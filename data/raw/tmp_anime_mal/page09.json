Thanks to cutting-edge research on nanomachines and medical treatment, people are guaranteed a life free of diseases, but they are expected to work 19 hours a day in return. Moreover, when someone disconnects from the SHELL system, an extremely rare phenomenon called \"Human Lost\" takes place, transforming humans into monsters\u2014\"Lost\"\u2014that need to be destroyed, lest society will collapse for good.\n\nHowever, in this society where the fear of pain and death is absent, antisocial behavior is on the rise. Factory worker Takeichi plans to besiege the Ministry of Interior to protest against his inhumane living conditions and manages to convince his friend, the unknown painter Youzou Ooba, to join his cause. But when their suicide operation inevitably fails, Takeichi is left with a body beyond repair and mutates into a Lost, with Youzou immediately following suit.\n\nIn the ensuing fight, a member of the dispatch team, Yoshiko Hiiragi, uses her ability to detect the Lost and discovers that Youzou has the unique capacity to return to human form. As the third person who survived after becoming a Lost unit, Youzou soon joins Yoshiko in investigating the recent outburst of Human Lost phenomena that threaten the last chances civilization has to be reborn.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 5.8, "rank": 9755, "popularity": 4690, "num_list_users": 19250, "num_scoring_users": 3738, "num_favorites": 38, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Suspense"}], "created_at": "2019-03-23T02:57:33+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-12-28T02:18:40+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2019, "season": "fall"}, "source": "novel", "average_episode_duration": 6561, "rating": "r", "studios": [{"id": 1023, "name": "Polygon Pictures"}]}, {"id": 54947, "title": "Spy Kyoushitsu 2nd Season", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1317/136666.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1317/136666l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Spy Room 2"], "en": "Spy Classroom Season 2", "ja": "\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u6559\u5ba4"}, "start_date": "2023-07-13", "synopsis": "Second season of Spy Kyoushitsu", "popularity": 4896, "num_list_users": 17393, "num_scoring_users": 1, "num_favorites": 38, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}], "created_at": "2023-04-07T13:05:18+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-06-27T07:30:54+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "not_yet_aired", "num_episodes": 12, "start_season": {"year": 2023, "season": "summer"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "thursday", "start_time": "22:30"}, "source": "light_novel", "average_episode_duration": 0, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 91, "name": "feel."}]}, {"id": 37287, "title": "Tsuma Netori: Ryoujoku Rinne", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1218/103770.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1218/103770l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u59bb\u30cd\u30c8\u30ea \u51cc\u8fb1\u8f2a\u5efb"}, "start_date": "2018-03-16", "end_date": "2018-03-16", "synopsis": "A high school P.E. teacher catches the eye of a man with unique tastes.

But 20,000 years have passed in their absence, and the Earth is a wholly different place.\n\nThe planet's flora and fauna now embody and serve Godzilla. Earth is a monster's planet, ruled by the largest Godzilla ever at 300 meters in height. Godzilla Earth.\n\nHuman protagonist, Captain Haruo, yearns to defeat Godzilla and retake the planet for mankind. There, he meets aboriginal descendants of the human race, the Houtua tribe. The Houtua twin sisters, Maina and Miana, lead him to the skeletal remains of Mecha-Godzilla, an old anti-Godzilla weapon, which to everyone's surprise is still alive in the form of self-generating nanometal. Taken from the Mecha-Godzilla carcass, the nanometals have gradually been rebuilding a \"Mecha-Godzilla City,\" a potential weapon capable of destroying Godzilla Earth.\n\nAs the strategy develops, a rift forms between the humans and the Bilusaludo, one of several alien races that had joined the humans on their exodus from Earth. Their leader, Galu-gu, believes that the secret to defeating Godzilla lies in the use of superhuman powers \u2013 namely, the nanometal integration \u2013 but Haruo resists, fearing that in defeating monsters, they must not become monsters themselves. Haruo ultimately uses his means for defeating Godzilla Earth to destroy the Mecha-Godzilla city so as to prevent nanometal assimilation, killing Galu-gu. However, his childhood friend, Yuuko, has been absorbed by the nanometal integration and has fallen into a brain dead coma.\n\nThe human race, once again, is lost. Metphies, commander of the priestly alien race, Exif, marvels at the miraculous survival of Haruo, he begins to attract a following. The Exif has secretly harbored this outcome as their \"ultimate goal.\" Miana and Maina issue warnings against Metphies, while Haruo begins to question mankind's next move.\n\nWith no means for defeating Godzilla Earth, mankind watches as King Ghidorah, clad in a golden light, descends on the planet. The earth shakes once again with as war moves to a higher dimension.\n\nWhat is Godzilla exactly? Does mankind stand a chance? Is there a future vision in Haruo's eyes?
