He opens the gift box and a hideous demon springs from it and squashes him beneath its fists, at which point the man wakes up, and realising that the events of this story have all been a terrible nightmare, hurries out to work, alerted to the potential dangers of a life spent in idle daydreaming.\n\n(Source: midnighteye.com)", "rank": 18678, "popularity": 17404, "num_list_users": 294, "num_scoring_users": 42, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "2009-11-13T00:34:47+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-07-23T17:43:27+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "source": "other", "average_episode_duration": 300, "rating": "g", "studios": []}, {"id": 7751, "title": "Midnight Horror School", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/87510.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/87510l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30df\u30c3\u30c9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30db\u30e9\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30eb"}, "start_date": "2003-10-01", "end_date": "2004-03-24", "synopsis": "The school has 26 students with each name of them beginning with a letter of the alphabet in order and a color, 3 teachers, 3 classrooms, a library, a cafeteria, a music room, a playroom, a fountain, a skeleton playground, a graveyard and several school staff. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "rank": 18205, "popularity": 13179, "num_list_users": 866, "num_scoring_users": 123, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}], "created_at": "2009-12-26T01:49:08+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-11-01T20:00:58+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 52, "start_season": {"year": 2003, "season": "fall"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "wednesday", "start_time": "15:30"}, "average_episode_duration": 660, "studios": []}, {"id": 10055, "title": "Black Jack: Heian Sento", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27872.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27872l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Black Jack: Tezuka World Movie"], "en": "Black Jack: Grandma", "ja": "\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af \u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093"}, "start_date": "1996", "end_date": "1996", "synopsis": "These original short animated films are shown in the \"300 Inch Theater\" at the Tezuka Osamu World in the Kyoto Station Bldg, as well as a two-picture show including animated films from among Tezuka Osamu's major Manga, and one focuses on historic episodes of Kyoto. \n\nIn this theatre, the Phoenix plays the role of storyteller, introducing two films. The Phoenix chooses a story entitled \"Old Woman\" (\"Oba-chan\") from numerous episodes of \"Black Jack\" to discuss the theme of how much love can grow in this short lifetime. In the story, there is a seemingly greedy old woman who is always asking her daughter-in-law for money, and her son and his wife become fed up with the old woman's behaviour. Naturally, there are constant quarrels in the family, and their quiet ordinary life seems to have been lost. \n\nAfter accidentally coming to know the family, Black Jack learns that the old woman had her young son, who was dying at the time, treated and saved by a noted doctor who claimed a great amount of money. She has, in fact, been paying for the treatment over some tens of years. Because of her great love for her son, the old woman devoted her entire life to paying for the treatment. \n\nNot aware of his mother's act, the son feels helplessly hammered and squeezed by his mother and his wife. But when he finally comes to know the truth, he is deeply impressed with the love of his mother, who valued her son's life more than her own. Black Jack asks him if he could love her just as much as she loved him. Explaining that only love valued more highly than life can live forever, the Phoenix then tells a story about the move of the capital to Heian, which was a great national project and an attempt to infuse a city with eternal life.\n\n(Source: official site)", "mean": 6.31, "rank": 7392, "popularity": 9942, "num_list_users": 2582, "num_scoring_users": 863, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 67, "name": "Medical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "2010-12-20T13:17:16+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-03T05:58:02+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 600, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": []}, {"id": 17223, "title": "Hana no Asukagumi! 2: Lonely Cats Battle Royale", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/45979.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/45979l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u82b1\u306e\u3042\u3059\u304b\u7d44! 2 \u30ed\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c4\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb"}, "start_date": "1990-03-23", "end_date": "1990-03-23", "synopsis": "Second OVA of \"Hana no Asukagumi!\".", "mean": 5.51, "rank": 10830, "popularity": 12686, "num_list_users": 1004, "num_scoring_users": 359, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 55, "name": "Delinquents"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "2013-01-18T17:52:04+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-12-25T18:40:19+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 1990, "season": "winter"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 3183, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 18, "name": "Toei Animation"}]}, {"id": 19271, "title": "Gekitou!

Near the epicenter of the activity, the expedition discovers vast land markings akin to the Nazca paleoglyphs drawn in the Peruvian desert. Stranger still is the presence of an enormous underground cavern below these symbols. At the bottom of the chasm, a portion of a tremendous tower juts from the ground. Armed with ultra-digital cameras, the scientific team transmits their findings to the Command Center. One explorer traces the image of a star chart engraved on the tower's exterior. The tower begins to emit a sinister howling as if possessed by demonic forces. One by one, the members of the expedition writhe in pain and die. Those observing the scene at the Command Center watch helplessly. As the high-frequency noise suffuses their headquarters, they too succumb and die in agony. When the waves of the frequency are analyzed, they are discovered to be a beacon directed at the planet Elysium, which lies beyond Earth's solar system.\n\nVan, the reluctant hero of the story, is an 18-year-old pizza delivery boy in Manhattan. He competes in the most popular sport of the 22nd century -- turbo jai alai racing. These races are fast paced and deadly affairs that integrate virtual reality into the competition. He's deeply in love with Lydia, a talented ballerina. In the chaotic futuristic metropolis, they only have each other and their dreams. Van and Lydia desperately want the chance to escape the polluted city-scape. Despite the dangers, Van enters a turbo jai alai race in the hopes of winning first prize -- two tickets to a galactic resort where Lydia can audition for the Jupiter Ballet.\n\nMeanwhile, earth's deep space observation vessel, the Odyssey, patrols the planet's orbital perimeter. The Odyssey is confronted by an armada of sophisticated alien spacecraft from Elysium. The awed human crew prepares to receive the Elysian ambassador, Yaspe. Without warning, the Odyssey loses control of its weapons, fires on the ambassador's vessel and destroys it. This tragic misunderstanding results in brutal retaliation by the Elysian fleet, culminating in the destruction of the Odyssey and a full-scale attack on Earth.\n\nVan's deadly sport of choice turns deadlier when the stadium he is competing in comes under fire from the Elysian barrage. Van struggles through the chaos on his turbo-cycle to rescue Lydia from the collapsing stands. The indiscriminate Elysian onslaught scorches cities worldwide. Van and Lydia flee through the burning streets of Manhattan seeking safety. After a series of harrowing escapes, they find refuge in a claustrophobic fall-out shelter. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "mean": 5.19, "rank": 11684, "popularity": 11599, "num_list_users": 1454, "num_scoring_users": 667, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "created_at": "2007-08-08T22:43:54+00:00", "updated_at": "2018-07-22T22:03:21+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2003, "season": "summer"}, "average_episode_duration": 5165, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 18, "name": "Toei Animation"}, {"id": 1231, "name": "OLM Digital"}]}, {"id": 4733, "title": "Blue Remains", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1377/112152.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1377/112152l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30ea\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3"}, "start_date": "2001-08-22", "end_date": "2001-08-22", "synopsis": "Post-nuclear Earth is barren, and life can't survive on the surface, so the few remaining people have lived under-water waiting for their time to be able to go to the surface.
