However, he felt sorry about what he was doing and hid her under the earthen floor of a barn. One day, a messenger of the lord of the neighboring province was sent to the lord of Shinano Province making an unreasonable demand that a silk thread be threaded through a winding hole in a crystal ball and threatened that force would be used unless the task was done. The devoted son consulted with his mother, and she taught him a method in which you put honey around the end of one hole and let an ant tied with a thread go through it from the other end. The lord rewarded the son. However, a messenger was sent from the neighboring province again demanding that they identify which of two identical mares is the parent and which is the child. The son asked his mother again and then told the solution to the lord. When told by the lord that he would grant the son\u2019s wish, he pleaded for his mother\u2019s life. Since then, old men and women have been treated with respect and are no longer exiled.\n\n(Source: Japanese Animated Film Classics)", "mean": 5.41, "rank": 11119, "popularity": 12056, "num_list_users": 1234, "num_scoring_users": 684, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}], "created_at": "2014-09-14T09:23:43+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-09-17T14:46:15+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 1080, "rating": "g", "studios": []}, {"id": 36021, "title": "Joleobban", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/87067.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/87067l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Senior Class"], "en": "The Senior Class", "ja": "\uc878\uc5c5\ubc18"}, "start_date": "2016-12-29", "end_date": "2016-12-29", "synopsis": "Joo-hee, a perfect student and the hottest girl in school, is majoring in pure arts and dreams of going to France.

When the forces invade to take him back, a girl named Rei Yuuki mysteriously shoots down their entire carrier with only a fighter jet! Apparently, both have mysterious powers that the enemies want, which may or may not be connected to their being the only two known survivors of the meteor impact.\n\nWhile looking for a third survivor (which turned out to be a cat), the two are taken by force to Queen Photon (ruler of the traitor regime), who claims that she is out to SAVE the Earth from those who sent the Meteor. The two don't know whether to believe her or Mello until the (telepathic) cat breaks them out of the Queen's sealed chamber, and Mello comes to straighten things out. That's when the two (er, three) of them make a choice... Stay on a planet that can't support their advanced race, or strike out into the unknown of space?\n\n(Source: ANN) \n", "mean": 5.93, "rank": 9203, "popularity": 9293, "num_list_users": 3256, "num_scoring_users": 929, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "created_at": "2007-03-06T23:56:14+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-27T18:56:19+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 1998, "season": "fall"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 2901, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 11, "name": "Madhouse"}]}, {"id": 23779, "title": "Akuma to Himegimi", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1276/134335.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1276/134335l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["The Devil and the Princess"], "en": "", "ja": "\u60aa\u9b54\u3068\u59eb\u541b"}, "start_date": "1981-03-20", "end_date": "1981-03-20", "synopsis": "Adapted from a fairy tale by Yoshida Akimi.
