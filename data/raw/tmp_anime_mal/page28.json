When the giraffe mother and the children were eating, they found that the dining table was broken. They were discussing to find grandpa panda to fix it. The little panda hummed a song and rushed to take over the job. As a result, the repair was repaired and the high table became a low table; Uncle Elephant\u2019s bath tub had a loophole, and the little panda repaired it over and over to make a block of wood. What's more interesting is that when it helped the little monkeys repair the boxes with peaches, they put themselves in them. Little Panda is far from becoming a qualified carpenter.\n\n(Source: Douban) ", "rank": 13806, "popularity": 21489, "num_list_users": 74, "num_scoring_users": 18, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "white",

Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji's story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can't put your finger on the reason why, it's probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii's artsy 1986 feature Angel's Egg. That, and Kenji's wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki's Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji's story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji's magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest.

Keyes uses this apocryphal tale as a parable for the antinuclear movement, as \"proof' that change would come if enough people joined forces.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)", "rank": 16787, "popularity": 18088, "num_list_users": 251, "num_scoring_users": 51, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}], "created_at": "2014-07-03T13:51:53+00:00", "updated_at": "2015-01-15T10:45:19+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 1986, "season": "spring"}, "average_episode_duration": 1200, "rating": "g", "studios": []}, {"id": 26115, "title": "Moudouken Quill no Isshou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/65989.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/65989l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u76f2\u5c0e\u72ac\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4e00\u751f"}, "start_date": "2004-03-13", "end_date": "2004-03-13", "synopsis": "A biographical anime about Quill, a real life guide dog.", "rank": 18398, "popularity": 18103, "num_list_users": 250, "num_scoring_users": 29, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 71, "name": "Pets"}], "created_at": "2014-08-23T09:44:30+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-03-24T15:31:37+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2004, "season": "winter"}, "average_episode_duration": 1500, "rating": "g", "studios": []}, {"id": 27651, "title": "Ginga Tetsudou 999: Niji no Michishirube", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/66929.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/66929l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u9280\u6cb3\u9244\u9053\uff19\uff19\uff19 \u8679\u306e\u9053\u6a19"}, "start_date": "2001-07-04", "end_date": "2001-07-04", "synopsis": "Short movie screened at the 2001 Kitakyushu Expo-Festival held in Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.", "mean": 5.95, "rank": 9129, "popularity": 13217, "num_list_users": 856, "num_scoring_users": 150, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "created_at": "2014-09-20T05:18:23+00:00", "updated_at": "2018-01-14T19:02:51+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2001, "season": "summer"}, "average_episode_duration": 1035, "rating": "g", "studios": [{"id": 18, "name": "Toei Animation"}]}, {"id": 28419, "title": "Katsura Hime", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/68569.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/68569l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Princess Katsura", "ja": "\u304b\u3064\u3089\u59eb"}, "start_date": "1937", "end_date": "1937", "synopsis": "Short film about a princess being kidnapped.", "mean": 5.06, "rank": 11937, "popularity": 13561, "num_list_users": 776, "num_scoring_users": 393, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}], "created_at": "2014-11-16T04:23:38+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-11-28T20:34:52+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 120, "rating": "g", "studios": []}, {"id": 29955, "title": "Insomniac", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/71850.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/71850l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["ALT - Insomniac"], "en": "", "ja": "insomniac"}, "start_date": "2008", "end_date": "2008", "synopsis": "Music video made by Ryo Okawara.

A young boy, Shigeru, left home for his job as a building excavator that morning, carrying a bento made by his mother, only to never return home again. Before long, his mother managed to find Shigeru's remains, and she noticed the completely black and carbonized bento box next to them. \n\nThis is an anime adaptation of the original book, \"Makkuro na Obentou (The Charred Lunchbox)\" written by Kodama Tatsuharu and illustrated by Kitajima Shinpei. The bento box that becomes the focus of the story is actually on display in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "rank": 17960, "popularity": 15401, "num_list_users": 458, "num_scoring_users": 48, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}], "created_at": "2013-08-20T09:21:16+00:00", "updated_at": "2013-08-20T09:21:16+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 1990, "season": "spring"}, "source": "book", "average_episode_duration": 3000, "rating": "g", "studios": []}, {"id": 21509, "title": "Trip Trek (2010)", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/56721.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/56721l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "TRIP TREK [\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af]"}, "start_date": "2010-11-10", "end_date": "2011-01-26", "synopsis": "More short stories featuring Zocco and Minime.\n\nThe series received the first airing starting November 10, 2010.
