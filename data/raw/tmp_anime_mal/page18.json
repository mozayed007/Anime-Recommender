Lupin sneaks onto the island where, instead of treasure-hunting, he finds himself embroiled in a violent struggle for power. To Lupin's surprise, his old buddies Jigen and Goemon are also in the fight for their own reasons. Marcus the Merchant of Death also lands on the island accompanied by Fujiko, Lupin's greatest weakness, and followed by the police inspector, who is forever on Lupin's tail. \n\n(Source: ANN)", "mean": 6.87, "rank": 4568, "popularity": 7140, "num_list_users": 6707, "num_scoring_users": 2843, "num_favorites": 5, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 50, "name": "Adult Cast"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}], "created_at": "2006-08-21T08:11:14+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-18T13:48:36+00:00", "media_type": "special", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 1990, "season": "summer"}, "average_episode_duration": 5540, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 65, "name": "Tokyo Movie Shinsha"}]}, {"id": 18573, "title": "Noobow", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/49785.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/49785l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u306c\u30fc\u307c\u30fc"}, "start_date": "1995-10-05", "end_date": "1996-03-28", "synopsis": "", "rank": 18685, "popularity": 16354, "num_list_users": 373, "num_scoring_users": 86, "num_favorites": 5, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "created_at": "2013-04-30T17:13:24+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-24T01:12:53+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 26, "start_season": {"year": 1995, "season": "fall"}, "average_episode_duration": 150, "rating": "pg", "studios": []}, {"id": 2958, "title": "Hitozuma Cosplay Kissa", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/103998.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/103998l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Wives Cosplay Cafe"], "en": "Cosplay Cafe", "ja": "\u4eba\u59bb\u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u55ab\u8336"}, "start_date": "2004-03-25", "end_date": "2004-08-25", "synopsis": "There's a coffee shop that attracts a lot of customers, but not because of the coffee, but because of the waitresses who are all married women wearing outfits that normal waitresses wouldn't wear. \n\nBut the story focuses more on the love life of Asahina Tomoya who's the temporary owner of the coffee shop. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "mean": 5.97, "popularity": 7864, "num_list_users": 5332, "num_scoring_users": 1912, "num_favorites": 5, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "2007-08-09T21:46:54+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-01-24T10:48:16+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 2, "start_season": {"year": 2004, "season": "winter"}, "source": "visual_novel", "average_episode_duration": 1560, "rating": "rx", "studios": [{"id": 2359, "name": "Aiko"}]}, {"id": 2959, "title": "Utsukushiki Sei no Dendoushi Reirei", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/4250.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/4250l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Rei Rei - Missionary of Love", "Rei Rei - The Sensual Evangelist"], "en": "Rei Rei", "ja": "\u7f8e\u3057\u304d\u6027\u306e\u4f1d\u9053\u5e2b\u3000\u9e97\u3005"}, "start_date": "1994-07-08", "end_date": "1994-09-09", "synopsis": "Sweat-soaked bodies writhe in passion as a nurse and a doctor plot to murder the nurse's young ward; meanwhile, a young man endures the despair of unrequited love, unaware that the object of his desire is in love... with another woman!\n\nIf these hardly seem like sources for high comedy, perhaps it's because you're not Kaguya, a strangely powerful being with the ability to manipulate the fabric of reality, an extremely perverse sense of humor, and a propensity for baring her breasts.\n\nA living manifestation of the Hand (or some other bodily portion) of Fate, those who fall under Kaguya's twisted spell will never be the same again, for she delights in giving people their hearts' desires-and letting them suffer the consequences!\n\nTogether with her stumpy man-servant Pipi, Kaguya stages her human puppet shows with the flair of a master show-woman, foiling perfect murders, turning young men INTO the women of their dreams, and generally causing mass chaos and disaster.", "mean": 5.34, "popularity": 9726, "num_list_users": 2777, "num_scoring_users": 922, "num_favorites": 5, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 26, "name": "Girls Love"}, {"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "2007-08-09T21:50:51+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-07-02T20:43:47+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 2, "start_season": {"year": 1994, "season": "summer"}, "average_episode_duration": 1688, "rating": "r+", "studios": [{"id": 1009, "name": "Aubec"}]}, {"id": 6287, "title": "Akikan!: Kan Ippatsu!?

An asphalt concrete highway runs through the area, used from time to time by various cargo trucks. Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Buck, a vulture; and Harchi, a hyena, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose. The main characters often find themselves falling off cliffs a la Wile E.
