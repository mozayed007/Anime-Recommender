The surge awakens within the five teenagers a latent power, giving them each a supernatural ability. Enlightened to their newly acquired gifts by Hisui, the young heir of the Kisaragi Clan who maintains his family's antiques shop - as well as their duty to protect Tokyo from Oni (demons) - the Magami students decide to use their power to protect the city from the onslaught of dark forces.\n\nBattling the demons alongside Hisui Kisaragi, the five unlikely friends discover that they may have to face a greater threat to Tokyo other than destroying a few malevolent, random monsters. The Ryumyaku had been disrupted by force, from someone invoking the Dark Arts - and that person has a wicked desire to unleash a long-dead evil.\n\nCan the teenagers overcome their own fears and flaws to fight against the Dark Arts?

Thanks to the legendary hero Shion Bladearts, wielder of Excalibur, and his loyal band of companions, the Gate was sealed off and the demonic threat was vanquished.\n\nUnfortunately, the seal was incomplete and has begun to weaken, allowing the demons to once again begin their attack. Worried about the safety of his village, selfish and perverted farmer Touka Scott dig pitfalls to defend against the demons. But fear not, for Shion is on his way to reseal Hell's Gate and save humanity!\n\nOr at least he was, because the legendary hero is dead, having fallen into one of the pitfalls Touka dug. Luckily, dealing with the dead is the specialty of necromancer Anri Haynesworth. While she can't revive him, Anri can at least salvage their quest by forcing Touka's soul into Shion's rotting body and dragging him along to Hell's Gate in Shion's place. Not wanting to be left behind, Touka's childhood friend Yuna Yunis tags along. Together, the three of them set out as what just might be the most unsuitable party to ever try to save the world!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 6.63, "rank": 5730, "popularity": 2070, "num_list_users": 91412, "num_scoring_users": 31137, "num_favorites": 298, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 9, "name": "Ecchi"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Harem"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}], "created_at": "2022-04-27T15:23:13+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-04-25T07:26:53+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 12, "start_season": {"year": 2023, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "friday", "start_time": "01:00"}, "source": "web_manga", "average_episode_duration": 1420, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 839, "name": "LIDENFILMS"}]}, {"id": 44059, "title": "Puparia", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1308/110285.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1308/110285l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Puparia", "ja": "PUPARIA"}, "start_date": "2020-11-20", "end_date": "2020-11-20", "synopsis": "Independent short animation by Shingo Tamagawa.", "mean": 7.62, "rank": 1354, "popularity": 3080, "num_list_users": 45537, "num_scoring_users": 22779, "num_favorites": 297, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 5, "name": "Avant Garde"}], "created_at": "2020-11-20T14:49:16+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-18T00:29:00+00:00", "media_type": "ona", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2020, "season": "fall"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 180, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": []}, {"id": 8277, "title": "Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27705.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27705l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls"], "en": "Samurai Girls", "ja": "\u767e\u82b1\u7e5a\u4e71 \u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba"}, "start_date": "2010-09-04", "end_date": "2010-12-20", "synopsis": "With its gorgeous landscape and prosperous people, Great Japan is the envy of all other nations.

Players move up and down courts based on \"shuffle matches\" that occur before practice begins each day. In anticipation of a game, the middle schoolers are asked to pair up with one another, only to find out that they would not be playing doubles with their partners. Instead, they are pitted against each other in a tiebreaker-style game. The winner of the match would be allowed to stay to further develop their skills whereas the loser would be sent home.\n\nFor the sake of tennis, friendships and camaraderie are all put on the line. As the fierce competition between the middle and high schoolers persists, the situations they find themselves in goes deeper than just playing to remain in the camp.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.54, "rank": 1600, "popularity": 2614, "num_list_users": 61977, "num_scoring_users": 30487, "num_favorites": 206, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 30, "name": "Sports"}], "created_at": "2011-08-23T14:53:24+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-22T19:16:13+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 13, "start_season": {"year": 2012, "season": "winter"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1420, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 10, "name": "Production I.G"}, {"id": 463, "name": "M.S.C"}]}, {"id": 36990, "title": "Non Non Biyori Movie: Vacation", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/93575.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/93575l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u306e\u3093\u306e\u3093\u3073\u3088\u308a \u3070\u3051\u30fc\u3057\u3087\u3093"}, "start_date": "2018-08-25", "end_date": "2018-08-25", "synopsis": "With summer vacation coming to an end, the girls are having as much fun as they can with their remaining time.
