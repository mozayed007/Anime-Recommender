With his mother in the hospital and his brother fighting on the Western Front, the boy lives only with his father and his dog Hauser.\n\nOne weekend, cutting away from his usual chores, Sterling, his friend Oscar, and Hauser head off on a fishing trip. On their way to the river, his dog catches a scent at the base of a tree. Unearthing a raccoon's nest, the two boys find an orphaned kit. A passing hunter has killed the kit's mother to make a fur hat, leaving Sterling to adopt and care for the orphaned raccoon.\n\nTorn by his fracturing family, a brother in the trenches, along with the ailing health of his mother, Sterling's bonds with life and the world around him are kept together and strengthened by life with his new friend, the \"ring-tailed wonder\" and scoundrel, whom he names Rascal.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 6.74, "rank": 5158, "popularity": 9476, "num_list_users": 3063, "num_scoring_users": 884, "num_favorites": 9, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 71, "name": "Pets"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "created_at": "2007-05-31T21:47:15+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-10T03:57:12+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 52, "start_season": {"year": 1977, "season": "winter"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "sunday", "start_time": "19:30"}, "source": "book", "average_episode_duration": 1560, "rating": "g", "studios": [{"id": 22, "name": "Nippon Animation"}]}, {"id": 36625, "title": "Ajin Part 2 OVA", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1575/132721.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1575/132721l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Satou: Zero"], "en": "", "ja": "\u4e9c\u4eba (\u4f50\u85e4 ZERO)"}, "start_date": "2017-04-07", "end_date": "2017-04-07", "synopsis": "Bundled with the limited edition tenth manga volume.

They crash into a black hole which is connected to another universe. The people on the ship are cast adrift in an emergency capsule to a planet called Ismo. The story begins 12 years after they have reached Ismo.\n\nIsmo is a star of the Onam System, which corresponds to the Solar System in our universe. It is the only planet left in the Onam System. The Death Star called Yomi is a comet which regularly approaches the Onam System.\n\nThere were once 8 planets in the Onam System. Many years ago, in the time of the gods, there was a war against the evil monster Yamatano Orochi (an 8-headed snake-like creature). The gods won the battle. Yamatano Orochi was locked into 8 stones, one of which is buried deep in the center of each planet. Nobody was supposed to have access to the core of the planets. However Tsukuyomi, an evil god who rules Yomi, succeeded in reaching the stones one after another, destroying 7 of the planets using his powerful robots, the Sky Warriors. However, when he tried to acquire the last stone from the planet Ismo, the most powerful Sky Warrior, Susanoo, got out of control and was blown away.\n\nA million years later, the Death Star Yomi is approaching the Onam System once again. Tsukuyomi, the master of Yomi, plans to take this opportunity to realize his dream of ruling the entire universe. He is desperate for the last stone containing Yamatano Orochi. If Tsukuyomi can get hold of this stone, Yamatano Orochi will return to life and its power will become his. Tsukuyomi needs Sky Warrior Susanoo to capture the stone, and sends 8 Sky Soldiers to get Susanoo back. But it is too late. Susanoo no longer belongs to Tsukuyomi. It belongs to Takeru, a 13-year-old boy from Earth, who happened to discover the buried robot Susanoo and woke it from its million-year-long sleep. Takeru becomes involved in the battle against the Sky Soldiers and their evil master, Tsukuyomi. Susanoo stands up to protect his friends and their planet.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)", "mean": 6.58, "rank": 5944, "popularity": 10101, "num_list_users": 2439, "num_scoring_users": 580, "num_favorites": 9, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 29, "name": "Space"}], "created_at": "2008-06-26T08:39:19+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-11-06T09:19:11+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 37, "start_season": {"year": 1994, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "saturday", "start_time": "17:30"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 22, "name": "Nippon Animation"}]}, {"id": 50597, "title": "Massara", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1485/120354.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1485/120354l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u307e\u3063\u3055\u3089"}, "start_date": "2021-11-30", "end_date": "2021-11-30", "synopsis": "Massara is an original short inspired from the song of the same name by Kiyoe Yoshioka (of Ikimono-gakari).

So, he and his team take Wicke along on their journeys to give him the experience he'll need to be a real Viking. Yet, somehow Halvar and his men end up trapped or hopelessly stuck somewhere in most cases, and it`s up to Wickie alone to help them out with his flashes of wit.\n\n(Source: IMDb)", "mean": 6.62, "rank": 5777, "popularity": 9010, "num_list_users": 3573, "num_scoring_users": 1742, "num_favorites": 8, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}], "created_at": "2007-07-22T23:04:27+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-04T10:45:46+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 78, "start_season": {"year": 1974, "season": "spring"}, "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "g", "studios": [{"id": 22, "name": "Nippon Animation"}]}, {"id": 5908, "title": "Chinpui", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/74871.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/74871l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Timpui"], "en": "", "ja": "\u30c1\u30f3\u30d7\u30a4"}, "start_date": "1989-02-11", "end_date": "1991-04-18", "synopsis": "TV anime show based on the manga by F.

The Earth is in a time of prosperity. The president of the Terran League (the \"Galaxy Alliance\" in Voltron) launches a mission to explore beyond the galaxy. After commencing its mission of exploration, the starship Rugger-Guard is attacked by a ship of the Galbeston Empire. Dairugger, the super robot, is deployed in order to defend the Earth. It is somewhat by fate that they must help the people of Galbeston find a new planet before it explodes, and liberate it from its despotic Emperor. In the Japanese version, it does not have anything to do with King of the Beasts GoLion, as opposed to the U.S. version, Voltron: Defender of the Universe.\n\nThere are three assault team units: Land, Air, and Sea. There are a total of 15 parts referred to as \"Rugger,\" which can combine together to form the super-robot Dairugger. The design of the 15 separate Rugger units came from the sport of rugby, since 15 players are required to form a rugby union. The U.S. version would rename the \"Galbeston Empire\" to \"Drule Empire,\" along with editing a fair amount of violence and sexual content to keep the show safe for general audience broadcast.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "mean": 6.33, "rank": 7277, "popularity": 9945, "num_list_users": 2579, "num_scoring_users": 827, "num_favorites": 8, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1,
