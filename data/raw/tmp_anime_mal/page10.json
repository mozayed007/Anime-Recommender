The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as \"Friar Tuck,\" they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.\n\nTheir bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons\u2014in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.\n\nThe girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort\u2014Alwine's accomplice\u2014who sought to attain the Lancaster's wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron's troops, led by Gilbert\u2014a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle's dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success. Thanks to his noble heart and heed for danger, Robin became rapidly known as the protector of the poor and oppressed. Beloved and highly esteemed not only by the villagers, but also and especially by the sweet and beautiful Marian he was.

Yagami Taichi, and Ishida Yamato, who defeated it several years before. Yes, it turns out that this jellyfish digimon is in fact Diablomon, the Virus-type Digimon that was defeated in the second movie. But this time, he's learned to make himself physical, and is sending thousands of copies of himself into the real world.\n\nKoushiro and Ken devise a plan to rid the world of the virus once and for all, but it'll take the help of all the Destined, past and present. Once again, it's a race against time to put a stop to Diablomon's plot... but even that is cloaked in shadow.\n\nWill the revival of Omegamon be enough to stop Diablomon a second time, or will the millions of copies prove enough of a power boost to shrug off the \"Digimon Champion of Justice\"? Of course, he hasn't seen the new breed of Chosen, nor the new techniques. It's a fight to the finish, with the destruction of Tokyo resting on the line. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "mean": 7.26, "rank": 2741, "popularity": 2881, "num_list_users": 51700, "num_scoring_users": 29558, "num_favorites": 31, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 15, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "created_at": "2007-04-28T20:53:13+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-15T12:56:41+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2001, "season": "winter"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 1800, "rating": "pg", "studios": [{"id": 18, "name": "Toei Animation"}]}, {"id": 4195, "title": "Kodomo no Jikan Ni Gakki", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/39447.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/39447l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Kodomo no Jikan: Second Term", "Kodomo no Jikan OVA 3"], "en": "", "ja": "\u3053\u3069\u3082\u306e\u3058\u304b\u3093 2\u5b66\u671f"}, "start_date": "2009-02-20", "end_date": "2009-07-24", "synopsis": "The second season of Kodomo no Jikan.", "mean": 7.03, "rank": 3864, "popularity": 3738, "num_list_users": 31539, "num_scoring_users": 16971, "num_favorites": 31, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 9, "name": "Ecchi"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}], "created_at": "2008-03-30T04:47:44+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-17T04:14:14+00:00", "media_type": "ova", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 3, "start_season": {"year": 2009, "season": "winter"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1380, "rating": "r", "studios": [{"id": 51, "name": "Diomed\u00e9a"}]}, {"id": 613, "title": "Onmyou Taisenki", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1971/100952.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1971/100952l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Onmyou Tai Senki"], "en": "The Chronicle of the Big Battle between Yin and Yang", "ja": "\u9670\u967d\u5927\u6226\u8a18"}, "start_date": "2004-11-30", "end_date": "2005-09-29", "synopsis": "All his life, Riku Tachibana has been raised by his grandfather.
