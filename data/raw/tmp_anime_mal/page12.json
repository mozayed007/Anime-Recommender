Assuming that he has failed, he runs away, so the rest of the cast hunts him down on a remote desert island to bring him back.\nThe Toudai entrance exams have finally come (again) for Keitaro. With all his confidence Keitaro sits for the paper, but ends up falling asleep and dreaming about Narusegawa. Waking up with barely any time to complete the paper, Keitaro thinks he will fail the paper and tries to escape from Hinata Lodge and forget all the memories with it. By a stroke of luck he meets Seta, but ends up in a faraway island with the whole cast trying to look for him.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "mean": 7.18, "rank": 3163, "popularity": 2867, "num_list_users": 52249, "num_scoring_users": 31510, "num_favorites": 17, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "2005-11-12T06:56:40+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-11-17T07:03:28+00:00", "media_type": "special", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2001, "season": "spring"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 2760, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 27, "name": "Xebec"}]}, {"id": 33728, "title": "Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari Part 1", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/82495.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/82495l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Chain Chronicle: The Light of Haecceitas Part 1", "ja": "\u30c1\u30a7\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb\u301c\u30d8\u30af\u30bb\u30a4\u30bf\u30b9\u306e\u9583\uff08\u3072\u304b\u308a\uff09\u301c \u7b2c\uff11\u7ae0"}, "start_date": "2016-12-03", "end_date": "2016-12-03", "synopsis": "Set in the land of Yuguto, the people thought that the land they live is the size of the world, but it\u2019s actually divided into several areas, each with a respective king.

The Novel Worlds are stories created by the human imagination, such as old folk tales as well as newer books. These living worlds play out repeatedly, and are necessary for the good of humanity. Princess Aura rules Mugen, which is an island continent hanging over an ocean from the skybound Novel Pole. The Great God Goal gives her power, but she may never leave the small palace island area. Their nemesis is the forgotten Spirit of Cats, Nyanma (real name, Chocolat), who was excluded from the choice of 12 protectors by being disqualified from the race (in actual legend there are many versions of this story). She seeks her revenge by distorting Novel Worlds with Jarei Monsters.\n\nWhen a Jarei Monster goes to a Novel World they alter the story, turning it into a different version, sometimes a parody of itself. Bakumaru, the Spirit of Mice, must use the Genmakyou mirror to reveal (\"Jarei Shouran!\") the evil spirit once enough clues lead to its identity. Often the Eto Rangers must play out some of the story to find out who or what it is, sometimes even taking on the role of one of the characters in the tale. After defeating the creature, Kirinda is called when Bakumaru holds up his hand with one of Aura's 12 gems on it and calls out \"Daikourin Kirinda!\" Kirinda descends from a dimensional slit and purifies the evil spirit with a beam weapon, calling out \"Jouka!\" (Purification).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "mean": 7.32, "rank": 2451, "popularity": 10390, "num_list_users": 2229, "num_scoring_users": 746, "num_favorites": 17, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}], "created_at": "2007-07-01T15:33:27+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-16T08:45:17+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 39, "start_season": {"year": 1995, "season": "spring"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 1530, "rating": "pg_13", "studios": [{"id": 44, "name": "Shaft"}]}, {"id": 39622, "title": "Bakugan: Battle Planet", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1477/100243.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1477/100243l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Bakugan: Battle Planet", "ja": "\u7206\u4e38\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d7\u30e9\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8"}, "start_date": "2019-04-01", "end_date": "2020-01-19", "synopsis": "The series follows pre-teens Dan Kouzo, Shun Kazami, Wynton Styles, Lia Venegas, and their dog Lightning.
