She tells him that everyone in the family is going home to her father\u2019s hometown. When Hamtaro tells his friends about it, Maxwell pulls out a Ham-Ham source book. It\u2019s a book on old hamster history. \n\nAccording to the book, there is a \u201chomeland\u201d for hamsters called \u201cHamja Kingdom\u201d. When the Ham-Hams build a sand castle and recite a spell exactly the way it is written in the book, they are whooshed to the Kingdom. When at last the hamsters reach the bustling Hamja Kingdom of hamsters, the popular King Hamja, the Mini-Hams that they\u2019ve met before in Ham-Ham Land, and many jar spirits called the Mo-Hams appear. A parade begins merrily with singing and dancing! But, the bad magic cat \u201cSabakunya\u201d appears suddenly, riding the giant sheep monster \u201cMee Mee\u201d, and starts to trample the town.

One day, a puppet he is carving out of wood begins to speak even before he has finished shaping it. The old man names the puppet Pinocchio, and treats him as the son he never had. The puppet is dreadfully naughty and causes trouble for the old man, but his heart is in the right place and he earns Jeppet\u2019s love as though he were a human son. However, tragedy befalls the pair. Pinocchio is deceived by the wicked fox Dino and his sidekick, the cat Witch, while on his way to school. Pinocchio and his friend Gina the duck are sold to the master of a puppet show, with little hope of ever reuniting with kind old Jeppet. The naughty puppet eventually runs away in order to search for his surrogate father, and finds himself in the middle of adventure after adventure, matching wits with the crafty Dino and Witch. His efforts to stay out of mischief never seem to work, and misfortune always seeks out our wooden hero. If Pinocchio can only manage to stay out of trouble, his ultimate wish will be granted and his dream will become a reality. Delighting and entertaining, The Adventures of Pinocchio shows us that a pure heart and good intentions are rewarded, and that true love can indeed create miracles.\n\n(Source: Nipponanimation)\n\nNote that the character is actually called \"Piccolino\" in this adaptation.

The Great Lord of Qingyang sought to use an alliance with the Xia Tang State to achieve his ambition of dominating the East. As a result, L\u00fc Guichen was sent as a hostage to Xia Tang.

Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.\n\nThroughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "mean": 6.19, "rank": 7949, "popularity": 10627, "num_list_users": 2065, "num_scoring_users": 882, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}], "created_at": "2007-05-31T21:43:38+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-09-28T23:55:06+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "num_episodes": 52, "start_season": {"year": 1972, "season": "winter"}, "average_episode_duration": 1460, "rating": "g", "studios": [{"id": 103, "name": "Tatsunoko Production"}]}, {"id": 9486, "title": "Ikusa Otome Valkyrie Specials", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/26234.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/26234l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u6226\u4e59\u5973\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30ad\u30ea\u30fc"}, "start_date": "2004-12-24", "end_date": "2005-01-28", "synopsis": "Specials bundled with the Limited Editions of Ikusa Otome Valkyrie.
