Our Mountains, set in Japan in the 1920s, follows an elderly hunter in his attempts to take vengeance on the enormous bear that killed his son. Kaiyose-Jima is a nostalgic tale in which a boy is sent to spend the summer with relatives on the coast after his mother is taken ill. In Sh\u00f4kar\u00f4, a mangaka looks back on the strange apartment building he lived in when he first came to Tokyo as an aspiring artist and the unusual people he met there. Return To The Sea is the tale of a marine biologist working on the coast of Alaska who becomes obsessed by an elderly bowhead whale and by Inuit tales of a whale cemetery.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "mean": 7.29, "rank": 4782, "popularity": 10580, "num_list_users": 1447, "num_scoring_users": 647, "num_favorites": 6, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-10-26T23:20:21+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 6, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3025, "first_name": "Jiro", "last_name": "Taniguchi"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 119286, "title": "Haritoge Clemmie to Ou no Ie", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/222002.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/222002l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Hedgehog in the King's House", "ja": "\u91dd\u68d8\u30af\u30ec\u30df\u30fc\u3068\u738b\u306e\u5bb6"}, "start_date": "2016-08-28", "end_date": "2018-11-28", "synopsis": "A hedgehog finds its way into the house of a man who can speak with animals.", "mean": 6.96, "rank": 9021, "popularity": 17478, "num_list_users": 680, "num_scoring_users": 251, "num_favorites": 6, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 51, "name": "Anthropomorphic"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-01T19:54:12+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 3, "num_chapters": 30, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 49622, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Yuine"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 134391, "title": "NullMeta", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/244289.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/244289l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u306c\u308b\u3081\u305f"}, "start_date": "2019-12-19", "synopsis": "", "rank": 33439, "popularity": 33089, "num_list_users": 177, "num_scoring_users": 26, "num_favorites": 6, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-17T19:38:25+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "currently_publishing", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 54160, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Kokamumo"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 9719, "title": "Ryuurouden: Chuugen Ryouran-hen", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/193331.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/193331l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["The Legend of Dragon's Son"], "en": "", "ja": "\u9f8d\u72fc\u4f1d \u4e2d\u539f\u7e5a\u4e71\u7de8"}, "start_date": "2007-03-06", "end_date": "2016-06-06", "synopsis": "Shiro decides to start up his very own dragon knight army after joining Cao Cao, which only contain 300 men!

After seeing the name tag on her racket bag, Ide puts all his efforts into passing the test for accessing the same high school she goes to, Makunogama.

He and his friend join the school tennis club, where they meet another first year, Takita Ruui, a very good tennis player with a little of an attitude problem.\n\nHowever things start to look better for Ide when his dear missing girl appears in the school! As it happens, he misread her name on the tag. Takada Hinako was well known as one of the members of the tennis club, but some time after meeting Ide for the first time she suffered an accident and has now lost the use of her left leg. Hinako is no longer a happy spirited girl and tells Ide she can't fullfill her promise.\n\nEventually the opposite characters of Ruui and Ide end up confronting each other in a tennis match.
