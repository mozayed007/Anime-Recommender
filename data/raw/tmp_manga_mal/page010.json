For years, Kiri has been working hard toward becoming a girl worthy of Tohya, but even now, she faces constant reminders that everyone regards her as unsuitable for him due to her lack of femininity.\n\nOne day, Tohya is scouted by a fashion photographer and agrees to work as a model for the agency owned by Kiri's mother. Kiri is concerned that Tohya will be preyed upon by other men in the fashion world, and so she begs her mother to hire her as well. Her wish is granted with a twist, as she is forced to pose as a male model under the name \"Tatsuki.\" During their first photo shoot, it seems that Kiri's worries are well-founded when the photographer won't keep his hands off Tohya. With the desire to protect Tohya warring against the fear that she will appear undesirable to him the longer she pretends to be male, Kiri must come to terms with her identity and decide if outer beauty is really more important than what lies inside.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.39, "rank": 3711, "popularity": 5791, "num_list_users": 3056, "num_scoring_users": 884, "num_favorites": 25, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}, {"id": 76, "name": "Showbiz"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-10-19T19:51:54+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 13, "num_chapters": 77, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 1949, "first_name": "Hiromu", "last_name": "Mutou"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 82281, "title": "Majo no Geboku to Maou no Tsuno", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/142747.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/142747l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["The Witch's Manservant and the Devil's Horn"], "en": "The Witch's Servant and the Demon Lord's Horns", "ja": "\u9b54\u5973\u306e\u4e0b\u50d5\u3068\u9b54\u738b\u306e\u30c4\u30ce"}, "start_date": "2014-04-12", "end_date": "2021-12-10", "synopsis": "Arsenio, the loyal servant of a witch, receives an order from his master, and this one won't be easy.

And mountains, let us not forget the mountains. Tall mountains with deep roots, filled with one of mankind's most precious treasures: diamonds. The name of this island is Malynera, and its king is only a child.\n\nPatalliro the 8th, King of Malynera, is ten-years-old. From the day he was born, everyone knew he was... unusual. He is a hyper boy, with flashes of genius, moments of thoughtless cruelty, and the ability to make a bad pun out of anything. Smart, but only a child and so he often does very stupid things.\n\nPatalliro! is his story.\n\nHe lives in a world very similar to our own, but where the bizarre is commonplace. He manages to get into all kinds of trouble, from international terrorists, to space aliens, to accidental time-travel. His first challenge as king is to stay alive, when a group called the International Diamond Syndicate decides that they want control of the Malynera diamond mines. This is how he meets Bancoran, who was assigned to be his bodyguard during a trip to Britain. It's also how they meet Maraich, who was one of the assassins sent by the IDS.\n\nPatalliro is almost always accompanied by his army of Tamanegi (\"Onions,\" so-called because of their onion-shapped wigs). The Tamanegi all wear identical masks, wigs, and glasses, and are known only by numbers. They are Patalliro's protectors, but protect the world from him just as much as they protect him from the world.\n\n(Source: cathion.net)", "mean": 7.75, "rank": 1450, "popularity": 13374, "num_list_users": 1044, "num_scoring_users": 227, "num_favorites": 25, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-05-30T19:12:33+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "currently_publishing", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 4814, "first_name": "Mineo", "last_name": "Maya"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 96414, "title": "Dies Irae: Amantes Amentes", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/182689.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/182689l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "Dies irae \uff5eAmantes amentes\uff5e"}, "start_date": "2016-01-27", "synopsis": "As the Soviet Union marches on Berlin in May of 1945, a secretive group of sorcerers and madmen gathers to perform a terrible ritual.
