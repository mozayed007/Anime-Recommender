However, due to his physical disability, he instead lives his dream vicariously through the astrophotography work of Tougo Amase. While he reluctantly accepts his reality, Subaru receives a design opportunity from his close friend Akari Tsurikane that propels him in the direction of the photographer he has always admired.\n\nAs they meet and start growing closer, Tougo becomes enamored with Subaru's determination and ability to triumph over adversity. One day, he invites Subaru on a stargazing trip he has planned in Okinawa. Scared of being a burden and his budding feelings for Tougo, Subaru initially rejects the offer, but Tougo convinces him he has no reason to hold back. Despite his initial hesitation, once he sees the beauty of the starry sky in person, his love for Tougo blossoms.\n\nHowever, Tougo's professional obligations pull him all around the world for projects. His overwhelming popularity separates the two, making Subaru's attempts to chase after him harder. Even if he has been shown to overcome a lot of physical challenges, this barrier may prove too difficult to surmount.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.38, "rank": 3770, "popularity": 17825, "num_list_users": 658, "num_scoring_users": 271, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-02-26T22:55:17+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 8, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 57167, "first_name": "Bisco", "last_name": "Kida"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 14513, "title": "Zettai Meirei", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/20803.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/20803l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Absolute Decree", "Absolute Command", "Goshintou Series"], "en": "", "ja": "\u7d76\u5bfe\u547d\u4ee4"}, "start_date": "2008-12-27", "end_date": "2008-12-27", "synopsis": "Part of the Goshintou Series.\n\n1) Zettai Meirei (Absolute Decree)\nA wise, genius chief priest, Kikyou, falls in love with the beautiful heroic spirit of a sword, Kazuto.
