There is no cure for this illness, but there is one treatment. That is to deliver her antibodies to another patient, Cildy, by biting into her body to transfer the antibodies. Cildy also carries an illness called the \"Louge Golge Syndrome\" which is the complete opposite of Souka's I-Type Vibeil Outbreak and Cildy carries no antibodies, which will cause her to become vulnerable to diseases. The two need each other to survive, but they notice as time passes that Cildy is becoming weaker and weaker. At the same time, Souka hints at a secret that Cildy carries with her.

From a young age, Jonathan has always dreamed of joining the order in hopes of being able to protect and serve his empire. Training beside him every day is Asuma, a young Casualry orphan.

After a demonic incident occurs during one of their sparring sessions, Jonathan and Asuma are separated from each other until the day of the samurai prentice exam, 10 years later. The time apart has created a rift between the two former friends and causes them to no longer see eye-to-eye.\n\nShortly after the exam, the two boys are appalled to learn that samurai must utilize demons in order to effectively defend the people of the kingdom. While Asuma vehemently refuses to make any deal with the enemy, Jonathan's devotion to his beliefs wavers as he forms an unlikely partnership with a demon named Al.
