Each of the eight stories in the collection is lifted from the Edo-era Japanese storytelling form. As Tatsumi notes in the afterword, the world of rakugo, filled with mystery, emotion, revenge, hope, and, of course, love, overlaps perfectly with the world of Gekiga that he has spent the better part of his life developing.\n\nThese slice-of-life stories resonate with modern readers thanks to their comedic elements and familiarity with human idiosyncrasies. In one, a father finds his son too bookish and arranges for two workers to take the young man to a brothel on the pretext of visiting a new shrine. In another particularly beloved rakugo tale, a married man falls in love with a prostitute. When his wife finds out, she is enraged and sets a curse on the other woman. The prostitute responds by cursing the wife, and the two escalate in a spiral of voodoo doll cursing. Soon both are dead, but even death can\u2019t extinguish their jealousy.\n\nTatsumi\u2019s love of wordplay shines through in the telling of these whimsical stories, and yet he still offers timeless insight into human nature.\n\n(Source: Drawn and Quarterly)", "mean": 6.84, "rank": 10799, "popularity": 20343, "num_list_users": 519, "num_scoring_users": 159, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-11T03:32:19+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 8, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3606, "first_name": "Yoshihiro", "last_name": "Tatsumi"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 37009, "title": "Storm Lover", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/66737.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/66737l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Storm Lover Natsukoi!!"], "en": "", "ja": "STORM LOVER \u590f\u604b!!"}, "start_date": "2011-06-22", "end_date": "2012-06-22", "synopsis": "Based on an otome game with the same name.
