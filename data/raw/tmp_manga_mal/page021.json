For centuries, the male population of Earth has survived by depending on only one woman, called the Holy Mother, whose ova are harvested to create genetically engineered children. By now, any concept of a world in which women exist as ordinary people is long gone. Society has re-structured itself around all-male families, and gay relationships have become the norm.\n\nAt the beginning of Marginal, the Holy Mother is assassinated by a terrorist known as Grinja. The government in power doesn't want to start a mass panic, so it pretends that the Holy Mother has only shed her vessel, and that she will be miraculously \"reborn\" in the near future. The public, which is superstitious and devout, believes this easily. Only government officials know that behind the scenes, there is a frantic effort to create a new being with an XXY chromosome -- a male capable of giving birth. (This is a BL misrepresentation of an actual phenomenon known as Klinefelter's Syndrome.)\n\nThe manga's story revolves around one such boy -- Kira, the product of a genetic experiment, who becomes involved in a three-way relationship with Grinja, the aforementioned terrorist, and Ashijin, a young man who calls himself Kira's owner. A complex plot and flawless world-building make the story irresistible, and Kira's search for freedom is as symbolic as it is gripping.\n\n(Source: The Pink Panzer)", "mean": 7.02, "rank": 8284, "popularity": 11289, "num_list_users": 1328, "num_scoring_users": 344, "num_favorites": 7, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-06-26T13:17:51+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 5, "num_chapters": 24, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3052, "first_name": "Moto", "last_name": "Hagio"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 23510, "title": "Inyouchuu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/38197.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/38197l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u6deb\u5996\u87f2"}, "start_date": "2008-04-03", "end_date": "2009-06-10", "synopsis": "Mikoto, her little sister Takeru, along with a mysterious talking black cat and their friend Yamato are the exorcist members of \"The black cat demon slaying office\" and of course it's their job is to hunt down demons.

For political reasons, Genji is relegated to commoner status (by being given the surname Minamoto) and begins a career as an imperial officer.\n\nThe tale concentrates on Genji's romantic life and describes the customs of the aristocratic society of the time. Much is made of Genji's good looks. His most important personality trait is the loyalty he shows to all the women in his life, as he never abandons any of his wives. When he finally becomes the most powerful man in the capital, he moves into a palace and provides for each of them.\n\n(The Tale of Genji (\u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e, Genji Monogatari) is a classic work of Japanese literature attributed to the Japanese noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu in the early eleventh century, around the peak of the Heian Period. It is sometimes called the world's first novel, the first modern novel, or the first novel to still be considered a classic.
