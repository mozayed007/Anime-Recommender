Fanning great gusts of destructive magical wind, it reduced nearly everything to empty wasteland before a knight appeared to challenge it.\nBearing a sacred sword and shield which repulsed magic, this knight finally struck the monster down after a tremendous battle. But this creature would not die, and as it lay immobile, the wind poured forth from its wounds unrelentingly. With the last of his strength, the knight planted his sword high atop the mountain where the battle had been fought, so that it would shield a part of the land from the wind. This was the beginning of Gimrey, and the reason why everyone is born with innate magic.\nAs time passed, people began to fight over fertile ground. ELNA SAGA begins right before the outbreak of yet another war, and tells of a princess named Elna. Born without any magic whatsoever and as such being the only person who can actually touch the sacred sword guarding Gimrey, she becomes a pawn used by her kingdom to threaten other countries with destruction. A rival kingdom's assassination attempt turns rescue, however, when the ones behind this plot reveal that they have no qualms about killing Elna as long as they can maintain a facade using a lookalike. With the help of her would-be assassin, who is drawn to her innocence and compassion, Elna journeys to define herself and stop a terrible war that her country has started.\nThe first thing one notices is the richness of the world in which this series has been set. The ideas behind ELNA SAGA are drawn loosely from Nordic culture and mythology and the story, people, and names all bear a medieval Northern European flavor. There are no gods or non-human races, but Valkyries, Berserks, and the world tree Yggdrasil make their appearance in one form or another, and the castles and towns evoke nostalgic memories of old storybooks. \n\n(Source: MU)", "rank": 20476, "popularity": 42965, "num_list_users": 89, "num_scoring_users": 13, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2011-09-23T18:32:35+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 13, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 11553, "first_name": "Shouko", "last_name": "Tsutsumi"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 148713, "title": "Ultra-Alternate Character", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/263835.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/263835l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Ultra Alter", "Choegang Bukae"], "en": "Ultra-Alternate Character", "ja": "\ucd5c\uac15\ubd80\uce90"}, "start_date": "2021-09-16", "synopsis": "In Ergosphere Online, a VR MMORPG craze, Oreum Lee is harshly mocked by his party members for being a mediocre healer.

Unfortunately, the contents of the novel were exposed to her peers, and soon after, Ryuunosuke transferred away. The incident has weighed on Misora's conscience ever since.\n\nCoincidentally, Ryuunosuke\u2014now bearing the surname Ichinose\u2014transfers into Misora's high school. Not only do they share a class again, but they are now also neighbors. She takes this opportunity to apologize, but surprisingly, he does not seem angry. Ryuunosuke loves his brother even more than he did then, but he is clear that his feelings are purehearted. If he has romantic interest in anyone, it is her. Just when Misora is ready to laugh off her regrets, she is properly introduced to the elder Ichinose for the first time. Rather than treating her politely, Subaru acts like a jealous lover scorning a rival!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 6.55, "rank": 14385, "popularity": 13003, "num_list_users": 1086,

He was active as a sword saint in a previous life and as a sage in another. But he's been forced to work hard all his life, and he's sick of being a hero! One day, Noah dies and wakes up to find that he has been reborn as a prince. He has a high level of magical talent and the swordsmanship of a sword saint, but he doesn't want to get busy again, so Noah pretends to be incompetent with all his might. Then, on his 15th birthday. A skill appraisal reveals that he is incompetent (actually, he is just hiding it with his concealment skill). Noah is scorned and banished. With what seems like a gesture of warmth, his father gives him a remote territory.\n\n\"Now I'll enjoy my second life!\" Noah is enthusiastic, but he doesn't know.\n\nActually, the territory is in the devil's forest, which is said to be uninhabitable. But his past life was more advanced compared to this one, and the level of human beings in this world is lower. Noah's ability is revealed when he helps a girl who is being attacked by a monster in the forest.\n\n\"Amazing!!! Noah-sama defeated a dragon with a single blow!\"\n\n\"How did this happen? Ahhhhh!\"\n\nOn the other hand, the royal family also notices Noah's ability and comes to take him back, but it is too late. At that time, Noah is already being praised by the people as the lord of the Demon Forest.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)", "rank": 26194, "popularity": 59836, "num_list_users": 29, "num_scoring_users": 3, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 73, "name": "Reincarnation"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-05-13T16:46:43+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "currently_publishing", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 19699, "first_name": "Rio", "last_name": "Nanamomo"}, "role": "Art"}, {"node": {"id": 49135, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Ibarakino"}, "role": "Story"}]}, {"id": 17649, "title": "Momota no Hana", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/34996.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/34996l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30e2\u30e2\u30bf\u30ce\u30cf\u30ca"}, "start_date": "2006-06-27", "end_date": "2007-08-27", "synopsis": "Sunohara Momota just recently transferred schools to a quiet part of the country and is settling in.
