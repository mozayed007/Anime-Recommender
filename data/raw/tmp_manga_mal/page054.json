When Keiko finds a receipt from a love hotel in her boyfriend Shun's pocket, however-a hotel that she has never visited-doubt and suspicion begin to take hold of her imagination. Her worst fears seem to be confirmed when Shun mentions his new \"friend\" Kiku, a pretty, flirtatious girl in Shun's music club who is all too popular with the boys. Keiko, meanwhile, has her own share of trouble resisting temptation while Shun is away.

A great forest, infested with flameling creatures and other fallen beasts, covers the world, and pockets of humanity live in small protected communities. Due to a special weapon used in the Last War, human beings spontaneously burst into flame even when merely getting close to a small source of fire. The only safe energy source for humanity lies within the bodies of flamelings, and the duty to hunt them falls to the sickle-wielding firecatchers who brave the depths of the great forest. \n\nAmong the firecatchers, they whisper tales of one who would be \"Firecatcher Lord,\" an individual who will be able to harvest the fire of the thousand-year comet, the \"Wandering Spark\" that has flown in the sky since it was sent up before the Last War, but is now returning to earth.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "rank": 27762, "popularity": 29546, "num_list_users": 234, "num_scoring_users": 9, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-03-19T09:15:30+00:00", "media_type": "novel", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 4, "num_chapters": 57, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 52615, "first_name": "Rieko", "last_name": "Hinata"}, "role": "Story"}]}, {"id": 91043, "title": "Kyou wa Imouto ga Seme", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/159925.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/159925l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Today My Little Sister Takes the Lead"], "en": "", "ja": "\u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u59b9\u304c\u653b\u3081"}, "start_date": "2013-12-31", "end_date": "2013-12-31", "synopsis": "", "popularity": 32365, "num_list_users": 187, "num_scoring_users": 66, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2019-04-24T03:42:45+00:00", "media_type": "doujinshi", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 17369, "first_name": "Con", "last_name": "Yukiu"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 31395, "title": "Antique Rose", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/57807.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/57807l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba"}, "start_date": "2009", "end_date": "2009", "synopsis": "", "popularity": 37234, "num_list_users": 131, "num_scoring_users": 18, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 49, "name": "Erotica"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2011-11-02T10:52:42+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 12, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3072, "first_name": "Akira", "last_name": "Kanbe"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 99235, "title": "Akuyaku Tensei dakedo Doushite Kou Natta.", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/235250.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/235250l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["I Reincarnated as a Noble Girl Villainess But Why Did It Turn Out This Way?"], "en": "", "ja": "\u60aa\u5f79\u8ee2\u751f\u3060\u3051\u3069\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u3053\u3046\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002"}, "start_date": "2016-08-12", "end_date": "2018-04-12", "synopsis": "Eliza Kaldia, who reincarnated as a noble girl villainess in a fantasy otome game, was stuck in a world that seemed far from her image of how noble girls should be living, as the fated events of the game were still far off while she remained a child.

As in works like \u201cThe Sky Is Blue with a Single Cloud\u201d and \u201cMax,\u201d the gender of many of Tsurita's strong and sensual protagonists is ambiguous, marking an early exploration of gender fluidity.
