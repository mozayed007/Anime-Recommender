After one of these fights goes too far, the two are issued a joint punishment, and alone together, Ishio issues Mochizuki a warning. In this world of subgenders, an omega's pheromones make them vulnerable to the sexual desires of an alpha, and Ishio feels that Mochizuki is not being careful enough. Along with these words of caution, Ishio makes a startling confession: he has always looked at his fellow captain through the eyes of an alpha and holds a deep attraction toward him. Despite Mochizuki's protests, Ishio demands that he stay far away from him.\n\nOffended and carrying the impression that Ishio is simply looking down on him, Mochizuki plots the best way to teach the arrogant alpha a lesson. All it takes for inspiration to strike is an awkward encounter in the gym's locker room\u2014and Ishio's very telling reaction to Mochizuki's bare skin. Choosing to take the route of sexual harassment, the judo captain is determined to make Ishio squirm, completely unaware of the truth behind the alpha's words. His attraction is genuine, and there are dangerous alphas\u2014but Ishio may not be one of them\u2014as there are far greater threats to Mochizuki.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.1, "popularity": 7288, "num_list_users": 2348, "num_scoring_users": 1236, "num_favorites": 5, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 49, "name": "Erotica"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-10-09T20:31:06+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 5, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 49332, "first_name": "Honoji", "last_name": "Tokita"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 1985, "title": "Last Client", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/272086.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/272086l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["The Last Client"], "en": "", "ja": "\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8"}, "start_date": "2002", "end_date": "2002", "synopsis": "The story is about a young male prostitute named Aya and a former assassin named Chris.

Originally rumored to be a new, full-blown manga to replace V-Tamer 01, it eventually transpired to be mostly prose text, printed in the booklets which accompanied the \"Pendulum X\" digital pets. These booklets also contained short, non-sequitur six-page manga. There are four \"chapters\", one sold with the Pendulum X 1.0, another with the Pendulum X 1.5, another with the Pendulum X 2.0, and the final chapter with the Pendulum X 3.0.\n\nThis fiction tells the story of a Digital World controlled by a scientist computer named Yggdrasil. Because Digimon had multiplied so much in the past, Yggdrasil, the host computer, was unable to handle the load and the Digital Hazard occurred. Yggdrasil then created the \"New Digital World,\" consisting of three layers for the past, present, and future - Urd, Versandi, and Skuld respectively - and then let loose with Project Ark and the X Program to eliminate any Digimon Yggdrasil no longer wanted. However, the Digimon adapted by obtaining a program called the X-Antibody, which strengthened them, changed their form, and made them immune to the X Program. Yggdrasil sent in the Royal Knights, thirteen Digimon devoted to keeping order in the Digital World, and at this point Kouta, Yuuji, and Shinji, three humans, somehow found their way into the Digital World and met their partner Digimon - Dorumon for Kouta, and Ryuudamon for Yuuji. Kouta and Yuuji resisted Yggdrasil and the Royal Knights, but Shinji apparently sided with Yggdrasil.\n\n(Source: MU)", "mean": 6, "rank": 17326, "popularity": 13934, "num_list_users": 984, "num_scoring_users": 362, "num_favorites": 5, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-05T19:38:35+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 4, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 37277, "first_name": "Shisheni", "last_name": "Okorarana"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 11460, "title": "Love Blog", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/15501.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/15501l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Love Blog!!"], "en": "Love Blog", "ja": ""}, "start_date": "2005", "end_date": "2008", "synopsis": "Tired of immature love affairs, Eriko merge into the world of cyberspace, making her very own Blog on How she strives to reach her real happiness...

Legend says that an animal with blue hair and white wings is to be the hero and savior of this village called Animar. The hero will be sent by an angel and fall down from the sky. Additionally, Elder Tortoise has been safekeeping an item called a Smile Heart, which only the hero is capable of using.

During the battles of the 7th Space War, it was found that certain human beings had mysterious arcane abilities, powers of the mind to control and forsee. These gifted people were called Newtypes. They were valuable to both sides of the war; the Earth Federation designed the Flash System which allowed a Newtype pilot to control a horde of unmanned MS, called Bit-Mobile Suits.This was an effective weapon, but sacrificed the lives of many Newtypes. \n\nSpace fought back for principal, believing the effect of living in Space heightened every human ability and eventually created the prized power of a Newtype, who was not something to use as a tool for war. But in the end, mankind was its own downfall. During the final battle, the Space Revolution Army (SRA) crashed numerous colonies into the planet Earth, with a devastating effect. \n\nMillions died as a result of the colony drop. Those that were fortunate enough to find refuge in a Shelter were both blessed and cursed; they wouldn't see the sun again for four years. The rest that made it through had to endure and suffer with living on a ruined planet, plagued by an endless winter and an ever-changing, chaotic atmosphere. With that, the war had ended. For now. But everyone who continued to live on was possessed by that tragic war, and the word \"Newtype\"... \n\nThe year is After War 0015, and life on Earth is finally on its way to creating a more perfect world, except for the ruthless mercenaries who use mobile suits to make a living raiding; called Vultures, some of these people are merely chasing money, while others are running from the past. Enter 15 year old Garrod Ran, an orphan of the war. He is a lively and friendly boy who is trying to survive in the wake of the war, living off his daring-do's and knowledge of MS. Because of this, Garrod is hired to rescue a kidnapped girl from a Vulture ship, called the Freeden, and its stoic captain, Jamil Neate. \n\nBut Garrod soon finds out that this job is entirely not what it seems; that the girl, Tiffa Adill, is actually a powerful Newtype, able to dream the future. And when Tiffa shows Garrod the Gundam X, Garrod can do nothing but bear witness to the suddenly changing times. He may learn that people's true intentions run far deeper, and that the Vultures and Captain Jamil Neate are their only hope for surviving the coming age, and the birth of the New Earth Federation. \n\nMust mankind repeat the tragic mistake of the past?

The main series begins with Hiryu living peacefully in Mongolia when his former superior, Vice Director Matic, forces him out of retirement in order to kill his best friend Cain, who has been captured by hostiles in the Kazakh SSR and has become a liability to the rest of the Striders. With the help of Strider Sheena, Hiryu manages to rescue and extract Cain, but he attacks them after regaining consciousness. Hiryu manage to subdue Cain, but not before Sheena is mortally wounded and dies. Hiryu uncovers a small device implanted under Cain's neck and learns that he has been the subject of a mind-control weapon codenamed Zain and that Hiryu's sister Mariya was under the influence of Zain when she went rogue. After Cain regains his sense and freewill, he decides to make amends for Sheena's death by teaming up with Hiryu and stop the Zain project from reaching its completion. The two learn that an organization known simply as the \"Enterprise\" is behind the Zain project and that Matic himself was cooperating with the Enterprise leader Faceas Clay.
