He's a robot with very human-like psyche. He once believed that he was human and he can even consume food, unlike many of the other robots of those times. While performing bounty-hunting duties on a strange planet, he has a flashback to the time he believes he was human... In this flashback, he and his partner are imprisoned and are given scarce food everyday. They share that meager meal, half and half. Yet as the days pass, the delivery of food becomes more scarce. His partner's strength is waining (she's a human being), yet Jack, though he feels the same consuming hunger as his partner, is physically still very apt. They're rescued several months later, but his partner had already died from starvation. Jack, who finds out for the first time that he's not human, still lives.

But what they dig up is a plot of murder and destruction, one that wipes out nearly the entire squad and leaves its two surviving members, the fierce Rei and her cool, handsome partner Uozumi, in a fight for their lives.

Without warning, the pair is under fire from the air as a hail of gunfire rains down. Are these the killers, and if so, what is their purpose?
