He rejects the gods, and boasts of the incoming age of electricity.\n\nThe topic of marriage suddenly comes up in Inako's household. Her father is one-sidedly making all the decisions for her, and Inako is about to give up hope. It is then that Kihachi draws out Inako's true feelings of wanting to run away from her family. The only way to stop her marriage is to find an unusual book called the \"Electricity Catalog.\" The book is a prediction book about electricity that Kihachi wrote when he was a child, but his older brother Seiroku took the book, and its current whereabouts are unknown.

By now, in the year 1980, the remnants of that forest have been paved over to form the streets of London, England. In these streets, the \"Alleyway Killer\" has been garnering publicity for murdering people and draining them of blood under the cover of night.\n\nOut for a walk one evening, Alan Everett stumbles upon a woman who claims she was being stalked, and who might have been the killer's next intended victim. Beyond being grateful to Alan for saving her, she also seems elated to see him face to face. She introduces herself as Marie Noblue and begs him to take her to his home, since she has no place to call her own. Alan is strangely comfortable living with this stranger, although her presence elicits fragments of memories that he cannot fully recall. When Marie is suddenly arrested under suspicion of being the Alleyway Killer, he does not know what to think. Did she contrive to cross paths with him and purposely enter his life because she was seeking revenge on someone who caused her to die with regrets nearly three hundred years ago?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot: Futago Kakumei", "mean": 6.58, "rank": 14074, "popularity": 8990, "num_list_users": 1798, "num_scoring_users": 793, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Vampire"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-04-10T11:16:24+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 3, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 12811, "first_name": "Minami", "last_name": "Mizuno"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 38223, "title": "Byuu Byuu\u2661Bitch", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/68567.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/68567l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Sensei!

The Hero soon comes to realise through his missions and association with his leaders that the corruption within the Empire's top tier has led to a country whose populace is enslaved and unhappy.\n\nThrough his friend Ted, he comes into possession of the Rune of Life and Death (also known as the Soul Eater), one of 27 True Runes that govern various aspects of the world. The Rune, ruthlessly hunted for by corrupt officials within the Empire and their manipulators, force the Hero and his companions to flee the capital city of Gregminster.\n\nThis early chain of events forces the Hero to cross paths with a rebel organization where he is sheltered, although he is only convinced of the need to struggle against the Empire when the hideout is attacked and sacked by Imperial forces. Recruiting the help of Mathiu Silverberg, a former Imperial strategist, the Hero's Liberation Army starts off as a small force working to unite rebel factions throughout Scarlet Moon, and eventually becomes a force large enough and powerful enough to bring down the Empire itself.", "rank": 44211, "popularity": 31531, "num_list_users": 199, "num_scoring_users": 55, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Super Power"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-09T16:07:49+00:00", "media_type": "light_novel", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 3, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 4813, "first_name": "Shinjirou", "last_name": "Hori"}, "role": "Story"}, {"node": {"id": 23043, "first_name": "Junko", "last_name": "Kawano"}, "role": "Art"}]}, {"id": 105554, "title": "Soukan no Replica", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/193703.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/193703l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Replica of Mother", "ja": "\u76f8\u59e6\u306e\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab"}, "start_date": "2015-01-09", "end_date": "2017-08-04", "synopsis": "", "mean": 6.81, "popularity": 26874, "num_list_users": 292, "num_scoring_users": 123, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-07-19T04:32:27+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 19, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 42190, "first_name": "Yuuki", "last_name": "Mitarai"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 127314, "title": "Momohime", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/253359.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/253359l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Princess Momo", "Shinsetsu Momohimeden: Momo!"], "en": "", "ja": "\u3082\u3082\u59eb"}, "start_date": "2017-05-01", "end_date": "2018-01-01", "synopsis": "", "popularity": 34548, "num_list_users": 159, "num_scoring_users": 66, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-11T01:54:28+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 7, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 56051, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Gesundheit"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 68691, "title": "A-bout!!: Asagiri Daikatsuyaku-hen", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/117505.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/117505l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["About!!"], "en": "", "ja": "A-BOUT!!\u301c\u671d\u6850\u5927\u6d3b\u8e8d\u7de8\u301c"}, "start_date": "2013-06-12", "end_date": "2014-05-20", "synopsis": "", "rank": 42012, "popularity": 25367, "num_list_users": 334, "num_scoring_users": 43, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-08-13T11:01:47+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 5, "num_chapters": 43, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 18811, "first_name": "Masa", "last_name": "Ichikawa"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 138067, "title": "Koibito Daikou wo Hajimeta Ore, Naze ka Bishoujo no Shimei Irai ga Haittekuru", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/247229.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/247229l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u604b\u4eba\u4ee3\u884c\u3092\u306f\u3058\u3081\u305f\u4ffa\u3001\u306a\u305c\u304b\u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u306e\u6307\u540d\u4f9d\u983c\u304c\u5165\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b"}, "start_date": "2021-01-01", "synopsis": "Ryoma Shiba, a poor college student, looking for a part-time job with a high hourly wage, and Himeno Kashiwagi, who desires a relationship while telling everyone around her that she is disinterested in love.\n\nSimultaneously, they discover about \"Lover's Agent\" from mutual connections, so they register straight away and ended up scheduling a date.\n\nOn the day of the date, the two meet for the first time, and despite their nervousness, they spent a lovely time holding hands and drinking tapioca, just like lovers.\n\nHowever, when Himeno's friend finds out the truth, things get awkward.
