He lives in the Saienji Temple as a Buddhist priest in training with six other nuns: Haruka Amanogawa, Sumi Ikuina, Hinata and Sakura Sugai, Chitose Nanbu and Yuuko Atouda, each of whom represents one of the bosatsu of the six lower realms of the traditional Buddhist cosmology. Chitose is the main love interest and has a love/hate relationship with Ikkou which is somewhat typical in many other anime, involving numerous misunderstandings, beatings, and angry tirades where the male is clearly at a disadvantage to the female. A side effect of Ikkou using his ultimate power is that immediately afterwards he turns into an even bigger pervert than he normally is. The subject matter of the series is Ikkou's self-destructive power and the powers of the other nuns and their training to control these powers, as well as their (mostly non-romantic) relationships.\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "mean": 7.04, "rank": 7993, "popularity": 13627, "num_list_users": 1017, "num_scoring_users": 360, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 9, "name": "Ecchi"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2017-02-01T07:00:23+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 6, "num_chapters": 30, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 2972, "first_name": "Toshinori", "last_name": "Sogabe"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 13656, "title": "Baba Yaga", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/196854.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/196854l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30d0\u30fc\u30d0\u30fb\u30e4\u30ac\u30fc"}, "start_date": "2007-11-27", "end_date": "2012-02-27", "synopsis": "A mysterious disappearance of a girl happened at a camp held by an association for kids some years ago\u2014\n\nSince then, the association didn't hold any action.

When the innocent and adorable Miki catches the pair in the act, she too becomes a part of Itou's perverted antics.\n\nTell Me Oneesan\nLike many university students, Shinooka is frantically trying to complete his report the night before its deadline. His drunk friends partying in his room make this feat impossible, causing him to lose his cool and forcibly kick them out. One of Shinooka's upperclassmen, the beautiful and alluring Kikue Orisaka, refuses to leave, developing a heavy sexual tension between them.\n\nSeeking Frontier\nTaa and Hinako are a couple who certainly do not shy away from making their sex as enjoyable as possible. In fact, Hinako often asks her female friends for advice on ways to please him. Her petite figure, however, more often than not makes such kinks impossible. Determined to succeed, she persuades Taa to penetrate the \"second hole.\"\n\nHer Circumstances\nYui is a captivating high school enchantress who allows male students to use her body as they please. But this brings no pleasure to Yui. In fact, she does this simply for her own perverted entertainment. After so much unfinished and meaningless intercourse, even someone as resolute as Yui can become sexually frustrated. Fortunately, her charming underclassman of the same gender, Sayori, is available to quench her lust.\n\nFar Behind Spring\nMoe Shinohara is a young girl who is terrible at swimming, so much so that she finds it difficult to swim 25 meters! Due to her incompetence, she is forced to stay after school to partake in extra swimming lessons. However, Moe isn't the only inept swimmer; she is joined by the good-looking and silky-haired Aki Toiu. But as the two prepare in the changing room, Aki unexpectedly announces her passionate love for Moe.\n\nAlone with Nee-chan\nAtsushi and Chiemi may appear to be the perfect brother-sister duo, but in reality, their relationship is an immoral and incestous one. Having caught her younger brother masturbating to her panties, Chiemi finds opportunities to dubiously coerce Atsushi into sex when their parents are not around. \n\nSpring Blossoming\nMayu is an adolescent girl who bears a forbidden and immoral lust for her own mother, who is oblivious to her daughter's carnal desires. So far, Mayu has satisfied her craving by masturbating in her bedroom. But when she walks in on her mother collecting some breast milk, she can no longer control her urges. \n\nMy Mother is a Witch\nMina is a cheerful and vibrant teenager who has a peculiar yet kind and caring mother. Mina always believed that her mother was practicing something strange behind her back, but all of her attempts to uncover her mother's secrets have inexplicably failed. One night, however, she catches her mother brewing trouble red-handed, forcing the young Mina to undergo a ritual deflowering...\n\nHeap of Love\nKenji and Miyuki are a young couple sharing a single apartment. While Miyuki is a hard-working and mature woman, Kenji's behavior is still comparable to that of a child. He is lazy, unhelpful, and can become overly interested in other women. But despite his flaws, he still loves his partner deeply. And like most young couples, Kenji and Miyuki enjoy the sins of the flesh.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "popularity": 37547, "num_list_users": 129, "num_scoring_users": 48, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2019-10-20T07:28:42+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 9, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 17319, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Ebifly"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 39259, "title": "Yosugara Sexology", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/69775.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/69775l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Basement Labo", "The Thing I Want", "Girlfriend x 2!", "Please Call Me Sensei", "My Little Cat...Should Be this Cute", "Watashi no Hoshii Mono", "Kanojo x2", "Sensei tte Yobinasai", "Hikikomori Counselor", "Orenchi no Neko ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga...

Asai Kei and Haruki Misora work for their school's club called \"Houshi\" club, which execute any missions received from the Kanrikyoku. Misora has the ability to reset the world 3 days. This means that all events and any memory of the past 3 days that \"could have\" happened, never happened. Kei has the ability to \"remember\" the past. Even after Misora uses her powers to reset the world back 3 days, Kei will retain those 3 days in his memory.

But his life long dream that no one else, not even his family, knows about is to be a manga author, which realistically speaking has near impossible odds of working out. The reasons why he keeps it a secret is because he'd rather not try if he's more than likely to fail and also because he doesn\u2019t want to end up like his classmate Anezaki Runa.\n\nRuna is also aspiring to be a manga author but is obsessed with it to the point where everyone keeps a distance from her because of her anti-social and weird habits. But one day, Runa finds out about Taiyo\u2019s secret and forces him to pursue his dream. Taiyo learns that throughout his life, he has cared too much about public perception which will continue to limit his ability as a manga author unless he opens himself up even if it means rejection.
