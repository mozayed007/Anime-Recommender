His secret hobby is that for the past 10 years he has been writing the \"character profile\" of a single girl. Her birth date, personality, hobbies, conversations, etc.... is all recorded in a large pile of notebooks. All this time this fictional girl has been his friend and lover, but now that he is in love with a real girl he decided to throw them all away.\n\nIn order to \"purify\" the notebooks, he decided to burn them at a nearby shrine.

As the storm gets even stronger, the lead character believes that since she confessed her \"weakness\" to him it is OK for him to show her his own \"secret.\" Filled with courage, the boy opens the bag where he brought all the notebooks... except that instead of notebooks, the bag now contains the girl (naked of course) he's been creating for the past 10 years!!\n\n(Source: MU)", "mean": 7.08, "rank": 7414, "popularity": 2696, "num_list_users": 6958, "num_scoring_users": 3267, "num_favorites": 23, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 9, "name": "Ecchi"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-23T02:51:50+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 4, "num_chapters": 33, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 12131, "first_name": "Shizumu", "last_name": "Watanabe"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 2720, "title": "Over Drive", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/191761.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/191761l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "OverDrive"}, "start_date": "2005-05-11", "end_date": "2008-05-14", "synopsis": "Shinozaki Mikoto is a timid and short-statured 15-year-old high school sophomore who often gets picked on at school.
