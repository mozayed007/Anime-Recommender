Keima is only spurred into doing something when he is informed that he will die along with the little girl if her dungeon core is destroyed.\n\nAlthough despairing at having wasted one thousand of her precious points on a frail human who sleeps all day, Rokuko soon appreciates that there is some level of ability in her new summon. Keima eliminates the immediate threats and slowly builds a thriving village centered on Rokuko's cave where unsuspecting human adventurers can farm monsters and level in peace, earning the dungeon a steady income of dungeon points. Through Keima's unconventional strategies, the duo develop their dungeon and their relationship, gradually rising through the ranks and gaining new allies and ultimately establishing themselves amongst the hundreds of other dungeon cores in the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.39, "rank": 3746, "popularity": 5709, "num_list_users": 3113, "num_scoring_users": 804, "num_favorites": 38, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 62, "name": "Isekai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-08-18T23:27:30+00:00", "media_type": "light_novel", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 17, "num_chapters": 136, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 24039, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Youta"}, "role": "Art"}, {"node": {"id": 40970, "first_name": "Spanner", "last_name": "Onikage"}, "role": "Story"}]}, {"id": 96266, "title": "Back Street Girls", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/188817.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/188817l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Back Street Girls: Washira Idol Hajimemashita.", "Gokudolls"], "en": "Back Street Girls", "ja": "Back Street Girls \uff5e\u30b4\u30af\u30c9\u30eb\u30ba\uff5e"}, "start_date": "2015-03-09", "end_date": "2018-09-15", "synopsis": "Would you give up being human\u2014or would you become... an idol?

Five years have passed since Kenshin Himura stopped the uprising of Makoto Shishio. Though the flames of his budding revolution were extinguished, the scars left in its wake are still felt across Japan. Remnants of his group\u2014though scattered\u2014still exist. Some have found peace while others continue to fight.\n\nAfter a remaining faction tried to revive the revolution, Shishio's old sword fell into the hands of Ashitarou Hasegawa, an orphan boy who has never known a home. The conflict also leaves both Aran Inoue, a 16-year-old half-Japanese, half-American boy, and a mercenary girl named Asahi Kubota with a hefty price to pay off, with nowhere else to go. But luckily for these individuals, the Kamiya dojo has always been a place to accept wanderers without prying into their pasts.\n\nThe three are keen to start fresh, so when two members of Asahi's former clan show up demanding her return, Asahi refuses and things start to get ugly. In the midst of the chaos, the clan members drop a package containing a picture of dojo proprietor Kaoru Kamiya's presumably deceased father and his location\u2014Hakodate, Hokkaido. With only this information, the members of the Kamiya dojo embark on an adventure across the sea in the hopes of finding news about Kaoru's father and the reason he is being targeted.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.16, "rank": 6258, "popularity": 5023, "num_list_users": 3602, "num_scoring_users": 804, "num_favorites": 34, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-01-04T14:06:19+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "currently_publishing", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 1890, "first_name": "Nobuhiro", "last_name": "Watsuki"}, "role": "Story & Art"}, {"node": {"id": 19497, "first_name": "Kaoru", "last_name": "Kurosaki"}, "role": "Story"}]}, {"id": 104373, "title": "Bouncer", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/191308.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/191308l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30d0\u30a6\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc"}, "start_date": "2014-09-30", "synopsis": "The manga centers on Jouichirou Shishido, a 19-year-old man whose frank honesty has cost him 26 part time jobs.
