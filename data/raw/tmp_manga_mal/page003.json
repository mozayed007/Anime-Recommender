Unfortunately, his attempt at avoiding trouble is foiled by a beautiful girl with silver hair who goes by the codename Siesta.

Arriving in a thick layer of makeup, a ridiculous pink wig, and a seductive outfit, Ha-ri is prepared to scare the man away so badly that Yeong-seo's father will be forced to stop setting his daughter up on blind dates. However, the handsome young man who appears in front of Ha-ri is none other than Kang Tae-mu, the newly appointed CEO of the company she works at.\n\nDespite Ha-ri's attempts to act as crazy and undesirable as possible, Tae-mu remains indifferent during their date and even proposes to Ha-ri\u2014whom he still believes is Yeong-seo. Caught in a web of deceit, Ha-ri must find a way to reject the oddly persistent Tae-mu or risk being exposed and losing her job. However, the more Tae-mu pursues Ha-ri, the more she begins to question her feelings toward him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.89, "rank": 983, "popularity": 2586, "num_list_users": 7250, "num_scoring_users": 3244, "num_favorites": 156, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-05-24T22:20:18+00:00", "media_type": "manhwa", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 10, "num_chapters": 124, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 53792, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Haehwa"}, "role": "Story"}, {"node": {"id": 53793, "first_name": "", "last_name": "NARAK"}, "role": "Art"}]}, {"id": 132877, "title": "Ren Zha Fanpai Zijiu Xitong", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/258777.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/258777l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Scumbag System", "SVSSS"], "en": "The Scum Villain's Self-Saving System: Ren Zha Fanpai Zijiu Xitong", "ja": "\u4eba\u6e23\u53cd\u6d3e\u81ea\u6551\u7cfb\u7d71"}, "start_date": "2017-07-24", "end_date": "2017-07-24", "synopsis": "With unparalleled strength, a harem in the hundreds, and rulership of both the human and demon realms, Luo Binghe is a typical male lead for the stallion novel Proud Immortal Demon Way (PIDW).
