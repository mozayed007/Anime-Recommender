The twist is that Sunred (referred to most characters familiar with him as simply 'Red') is a rough-talking, violent and rude hero while the villains of Florsheim (led by General Vamp) are for the most part polite, conscientious and easy-going.\n\nDespite this, both sides still stay true to their roles, with Florsheim dedicated to destroying Sunred and taking over the world while Sunred battles against them. Other evil organisations and heroes are also mentioned from time to time.\n\nEach episode is divided into various shorts of varying length. Most of the humour comes from the interactions of the characters, especially the main trio of Sunred, his girlfriend Kayoko and General Vamp. Kayoko and Vamp, for example, get along very well and she occasionally consults him about housework or cooking. In contrast, she and Sunred often argue like a long married couple.", "rank": 19534, "popularity": 19185, "num_list_users": 579, "num_scoring_users": 99, "num_favorites": 3, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Super Power"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-10T23:17:09+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 20, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 10326, "first_name": "Makoto", "last_name": "Kubota"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 26120, "title": "Lespedeza", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/48973.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/48973l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30ec\u30b9\u30da\u30c7\u30fc\u30b6"}, "start_date": "2011-03-17", "end_date": "2011-03-17", "synopsis": "Taiyou finds a stray kitten on the sidewalk and manages to find an owner for her.
