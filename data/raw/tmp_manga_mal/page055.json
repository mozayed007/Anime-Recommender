He has decided to finally confess his love to his female co-worker Shinoyama. Mistakenly though, he ends up confessing his love to Miura Keijirou because he took off his glasses. Keijirou is Tomura's opposite; handsome, tall and the girls love him. After going out for a meal Keijirou offers to help Tomura by being his \"love messenger\".

Because of his position where he works it's hard for him to find someone he can just talk to. With Nanjo's egotistical and blunt way of speaking will this one night job last as long as it should, or is this the start of a wonderful friendship?\n\nExtra story (chapter 5) Misaki is an average business man. One night trying to get away from someone he runs into a fast food place and ends up crying in front of Fujita, an employee. Ever since then Misaki goes there after work ordering the same thing.
