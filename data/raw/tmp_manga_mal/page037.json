The atmosphere of the shop and the owner's attitude are all in sharp contrast to the superior quality of the dress, but nothing deters the lovestruck Nanako from trying it on. When Hirata expertly alters it to fit her to perfection, she is over the moon, but she can hardly afford the price he names. Fortunately, she has no reason to worry, for Hirata offers to hire her as a part-timer in exchange for the dress. And what's more, this couldn't have happened at a better time: she is going to graduate soon with no job and no idea what she wants to do. Hirata repeatedly insists that she will be working at the tailoring shop only until she has paid for that dress, but it looks like Nanako might have plenty of reasons to stick around for much longer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 6.71, "rank": 12464, "popularity": 16695, "num_list_users": 734, "num_scoring_users": 382, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Josei"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}, {"id": 48, "name": "Workplace"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-27T04:26:08+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 6, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3673, "first_name": "Yumi", "last_name": "Unita"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 39005, "title": "Hentai\u2665Yamamoto-san", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/69393.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/69393l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Onna Kyoushi Ayako no Mankai Hoken Taiiku"], "en": "", "ja": "\u3078\u3093\u305f\u3044\u2665\u5c71\u672c\u3055\u3093"}, "start_date": "2010-10-29", "end_date": "2011-11-29", "synopsis": "1.

Tamosan\u2019s conversion begins with her mother taking her to \u201cEnglish lessons\u201d that consist of reading religious tracts. Over time, Tamosan is forced out of \u201cworldly\u201d activities and pushed toward a future in \u201cpioneering,\u201d or constant evangelizing, and becomes troubled by the congregation\u2019s insularity, encouragement of child abuse, and practice of shunning sinners and ex-members. But, she meets a like-minded young man in the Witnesses and builds a stable marriage, until their young son\u2019s need for a blood transfusion forces a crisis of faith, given the Witnesses\u2019 opposition to the procedure. Tamosan doesn\u2019t mince words in her belief that her former religion is a cult and a \u201cpoverty industry.\u201d Written originally for a Japanese audience who may be unfamiliar with Christianity in general, let alone its fundamentalist sects, the framing is as an expos\u00e9 of exotic practices. Some details will be familiar to Westerners (handing out copies of The Watchtower), while others are unique to Japan (Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2013branded chopsticks). The wobbly art features big-headed characters emoting against scribbly backgrounds. There are some rough edges in this outing, but Tamosan\u2019s vulnerability and anger make for a captivating account of life in a restrictive religious community.\n\n(Source: Digital Manga Publishing)", "rank": 0, "popularity": 0, "num_list_users": 0, "num_scoring_users": 0, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-31T16:38:31+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 0}, {"id": 5472, "title": "Yuki-doke no Netsu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/4/10353.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/4/10353l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Snow-Melting Fever"], "en": "", "ja": "\u96ea\u89e3\u3051\u306e\u71b1"}, "start_date": "2004-12-10", "end_date": "2004-12-10", "synopsis": "Takaharu has fallen in love at first sight with a girl named Mifuyu who refers to herself as a \"snow maiden\" who can not fall in love.

However, this gift had something that no other gift had, limitless growth.\n\nMoreover, by chains of unfortunate coincidence, Kai Heineman ended up being trapped in the worst, nightmarish dungeon.

But, what should've been a cushy life in high society, soon turns into one life-threatening hassle after another. Pulled in every direction, she is forced to go on a quest to defeat the Demon King, forced to keep her heroic quest a secret, and forced to re-enroll at the academy she left behind years ago, making her a downright \"fossil\" compared to her peers. Still, anything is better than living with her cold-blooded sister, openly known to have killed her own brother and possibly their parents too. Or so Ashleigh thought until she realized both princes attending the academy were after her allegiance in their pursuit for the throne. Trapped under her murderous older sister's thumb and stuck between a sibling rivalry over the crown, Ashleigh can never seem to catch a break.
