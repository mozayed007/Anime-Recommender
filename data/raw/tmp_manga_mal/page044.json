His exposure to their whimsical and teasing nature leaves him pretty much despising females. However, the high-school idol (Taniyama Maina) ends up having a crush on him. Her best friend is Nakajima Atsumi, your typical sukeban. Hokuto's best friend, Moriyama Syuuichirou, is the young-punk biker. These two friends conspire to hook Hokuto up with Maina, much to Maina's delight and Hokuto's chagrin. Into this setting we interject the jealousy of the rest of the high school, a female rival for Hokuto's attention, a number of fights, the inevitable parents recalling Hokuto, and Maina threatening to run away from home. We could go on, but pretty much everything is in here.\n\n(Source: ex.org)", "mean": 6.89, "rank": 10099, "popularity": 24184, "num_list_users": 370, "num_scoring_users": 167, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2014-03-16T22:46:08+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 3, "num_chapters": 21, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 12574, "first_name": "Naoki", "last_name": "Mizutani"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 75287, "title": "Hanamusubi", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/130569.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/130569l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u306f\u306a\u3080\u3059\u3073"}, "start_date": "2014-02-20", "end_date": "2014-05-02", "synopsis": "", "rank": 42725, "popularity": 28345, "num_list_users": 258, "num_scoring_users": 78, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-02-05T16:41:27+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 6, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 27021, "first_name": "Iku", "last_name": "Minamitani"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 141847, "title": "Menyatai Road: Narutoya!", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/254056.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/254056l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u9eba\u5c4b\u53f0\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9 \u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\u30e4!"}, "start_date": "2004-10-28", "end_date": "2006-02-02", "synopsis": "", "rank": 24962, "popularity": 59457, "num_list_users": 30, "num_scoring_users": 3, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 47, "name": "Gourmet"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-14T10:06:49+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 7, "num_chapters": 61, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 8564, "first_name": "Tamio", "last_name": "Baba"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 78103, "title": "Ginkou no Lighter Crois", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/160503.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/160503l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Ginkou no Kishi Kunshou"], "en": "", "ja": "\u9280\u714c\u306e\u9a0e\u58eb\u52f2\u7ae0\u3008\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30af\u30ed\u30a4\u30b9\u3009"}, "start_date": "2014-08-02", "end_date": "2015-03-20", "synopsis": "", "rank": 43070, "popularity": 51829, "num_list_users": 52, "num_scoring_users": 4, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2015-07-15T10:23:50+00:00", "media_type": "light_novel", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 5, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 19059, "first_name": "Tsukasa", "last_name": "Kawaguchi"}, "role": "Story"}, {"node": {"id": 23991, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Asio"}, "role": "Art"}]}, {"id": 12823, "title": "Usotsuki Marriage", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/17832.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/17832l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Deceitful Marriage", "ja": "\u3046\u305d\u3064\u304d\u30de\u30ea\u30a2\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5"}, "synopsis": "1.

Un Daro? is actually a series which Takaguchi co-writes with another artist. SEVEN is a solo work using many of the same characters, but takes place slightly later. It is about the members of the basketball team at a sports-based high school.\n\nThe first chapter focuses on a new character, Kiyoshi. Although he is attending a sports-based school, he is unable to play sports because of a childhood accident. He isn't dealing well, until Nana (Seven) takes him under his wing and asks him to be the manager of the club.\n\nNana is a senior and captain of the basketball team. Kiyoshi quickly falls for him. But most of Nana's attention is focused on his coach, Saegusa. The man practically built the basketball team from scratch and was manager at one point. He played basketball in middle school, but fell prey to some kind of chronic illness and wasn't able to play after that. All his life he worked with the goal that he would one day be able to play again. But suddenly, he realizes that it will never happen. He begins drinking and becomes depressed. Nana works to pull him out of it, and perhaps they grow too close...

More and more Japanese women had started working, and in the mid-1970s, many were more likely to keep their career after marriage or even after childbirth. Women began to express independence, refuse the traditional role of being a housewife, and divorce became more common. The heroine in Happy House is a thirteen-year-old girl. Her father is a television director and her mother is an actress, who is often too busy to care for her children. When the teenager faces the possible divorce of her parents, she does not want to live with her father or mother, because she feels that she cannot be happy with either one of them. Instead, she dreams of leaving her home to live alone and earn her own money so she can emancipate herself from her parents.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "rank": 41355, "popularity": 32177, "num_list_users": 189, "num_scoring_users": 8, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 42, "name": "Josei"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-01-26T02:37:37+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 2714, "first_name": "Kyoko", "last_name": "Okazaki"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 63009, "title": "Ikusora no Iro: Kinue", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/108015.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/108015l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u5c71\u4e39\u82b1\u306e\u5f69 -\u7d79\u6075-"}, "start_date": "2012-12-31", "end_date": "2013-12-31", "synopsis": "", "popularity": 35109, "num_list_users": 152, "num_scoring_users": 54, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2014-02-22T12:36:12+00:00", "media_type": "doujinshi", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 9632, "first_name": "Kyouden", "last_name": "Sanbun"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 63265, "title": "Don Quixote: Ureigao no Kishi Sono Ai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/109037.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/109037l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Don Quijote: Ureigao no Kishi Sono Ai"], "en": "", "ja": "\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30ad\u30db\u30fc\u30c6 \u6182\u3044\u9854\u306e\u9a0e\u58eb\u305d\u306e\u611b"}, "start_date": "2013-01-21", "end_date": "2014-03-20", "synopsis": "", "rank": 41423, "popularity": 44116, "num_list_users": 83, "num_scoring_users": 7, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Seinen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-03T09:25:32+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 15, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 11272, "first_name": "Yushi", "last_name": "Kawata"}, "role": "Story"}, {"node": {"id": 11273, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Yukito"}, "role": "Art"}]}, {"id": 802, "title": "Honey Baby", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/29994.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/29994l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["S", "Esu", "That's Another Law of Love", "High Standard Impression"], "en": "", "ja": "\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc\u30d9\u30a4\u30d3\u30fc"}, "start_date": "2004-05-10", "end_date": "2004-05-10", "synopsis": "Already wise to the world and yet still naive to love, 14-year-old Aizawa struggles for affection from the one he loves, his 27-year-old teacher, Tachibana.
