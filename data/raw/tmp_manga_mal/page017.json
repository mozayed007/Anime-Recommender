None of them came back.\n\nAnd to be fair, Souya never expected to be one of those explorers. But here he was, accepting an offer by a shady company to get enough money to save his little sister. Launched into another world, he soon finds that his journey will be a hard one\u2014not only have his teammates gone missing, but a majority of his food and weapons supply was destroyed in the transfer.\n\nThe only way left to go is forward. With only an AI companion to guide him, Souya ventures forth, hoping to find something worthwhile that will justify sending a rescue party to save him\u2014if such a party comes at all.\n\n(Source: MU)", "mean": 6.43, "rank": 15505, "popularity": 6266, "num_list_users": 2810, "num_scoring_users": 1196, "num_favorites": 10, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 62, "name": "Isekai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-03-20T22:20:18+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 12, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 50552, "first_name": "Kaoru", "last_name": "Hoshino"}, "role": "Art"}, {"node": {"id": 50553, "first_name": "Hinagi", "last_name": "Asami"}, "role": "Story"}]}, {"id": 115192, "title": "Oni no Youna Love Comedy", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/217458.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/217458l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Like a Demon Love-Comedy", "Oni no Youna Rabukome"], "en": "LoveCome Like A Demon", "ja": "\u9b3c\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30e9\u30d6\u30b3\u30e1"}, "start_date": "2018-08-02", "end_date": "2019-06-06", "synopsis": "Akashi, the strongest delinquent is feared as the \"red ogre.\" The one he falls in love with is...?\n\n(Source: MangaDex)", "mean": 6.65, "rank": 13214, "popularity": 6138, "num_list_users": 2868, "num_scoring_users": 1163, "num_favorites": 10, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 55, "name": "Delinquents"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-02-24T07:50:58+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 5, "num_chapters": 41, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 18211, "first_name": "Katsuki", "last_name": "Izumi"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 78073, "title": "Colorful Line", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/135227.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/135227l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Tomodachi ja Nakunatta Hi"], "en": "", "ja": "\u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3"}, "start_date": "2013-05-01", "end_date": "2013-12-07", "synopsis": "Shousuke always takes the role to comfort his best friend, Tomoki, who tends to fall in love and then gets dumped several times.
