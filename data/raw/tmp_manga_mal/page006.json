This stuns his friend as well as Youzan Miura\u2014an up-and-coming young professional golfer whose swing style has earned him the nickname \"Samurai.\" Following a brief case of mistaken identity, Miura and Hatohara find themselves playing against each other, upon which the former learns that the latter is a complete amateur who has no desire to play golf.\n\nImpressed by his opponent's innate talent, Miura requests that Hatohara reach his level and challenge him. With a newfound goal to strive for, the deadpan Hatohara sets off to secure a regular position on Eiai's golf team, in hope of teeing off against his rival again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 6.65, "rank": 13242, "popularity": 2054, "num_list_users": 8916, "num_scoring_users": 3932, "num_favorites": 52, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 30, "name": "Sports"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-05-01T21:58:53+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 7, "num_chapters": 62, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 6854, "first_name": "Tadatoshi", "last_name": "Fujimaki"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 96765, "title": "Gekijouban Naruto: Shippuuden", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/228881.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/228881l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Naruto: Shippuden the Movie"], "en": "", "ja": "\u5287\u5834\u7248NARUTO \u75be\u98a8\u4f1d"}, "start_date": "2007-08-06", "end_date": "2007-08-06", "synopsis": "Demons that once almost destroyed the world, are revived by someone.

But her impression of Origichi had been that she kept to herself and was unnoticeable, and as such, her life must also have been unremarkable.\n\nAfter the funeral, Suga is approached by Origuchi's mother, who mistakenly assumes that the two girls were best friends. The elder Origuchi wants to know about an ex-boyfriend that her daughter stubbornly tried to keep secret only years ago; apparently, Origuchi aborted their child before she became ill. Suga agrees to investigate this mystery, gradually gaining the assistance of former upperclassman Takashi Yanai, class celebrity Madoka Setouchi, faithful tag-along Remi Nishida, and enigmatic playboy Hikaru Narumi.\n\nAlthough Suga was not close with Origuchi when she was alive, she is strangely determined to know the other girl better after her death. She starts to piece together the events that happened in their second year of high school. As Suga seeks the truth from those suspected to be involved with Origuchi, she must learn how to open up to others and be more honest herself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.7, "rank": 1625, "popularity": 4133, "num_list_users": 4453, "num_scoring_users": 1325, "num_favorites": 50, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 46, "name": "Award Winning"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-07T22:38:29+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 10, "num_chapters": 21, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 2302, "first_name": "Hinako", "last_name": "Ashihara"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 16104, "title": "Joshiraku", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/122429.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/122429l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u3058\u3087\u3057\u3089\u304f"}, "start_date": "2009-09-09", "end_date": "2013-09-09", "synopsis": "\"This manga is about cute girls and what they do to entertain themselves.
