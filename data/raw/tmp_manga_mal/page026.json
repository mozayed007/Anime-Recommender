Nero shall be its last member.\n\nJuvenile and brash, the empire's youngest ruler takes the stage almost unwillingly, more interested in reciting Greek theatre than delivering speeches. His reign is paradoxical, as the teenage emperor shows callousness to his allies yet compassion for his subjects. Despite this demeanor, Nero seems to be the salvation of the Roman Empire: with his reforms, the senate no longer yearns for the restoration of the Roman Republic. However, as his authority and influence grow, Nero's greed soon becomes insatiable.\n\nSlowly succumbing to madness, Nero finds himself driven by desire, alienating and assassinating even his family and closest advisors. To the end of his life, he coats his hands in blood like the very blood that brought him to the throne.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 6.58, "rank": 14061, "popularity": 17995, "num_list_users": 647, "num_scoring_users": 205, "num_favorites": 4, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-11-19T14:42:19+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 15, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 2220, "first_name": "Yoshikazu", "last_name": "Yasuhiko"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 104253, "title": "Yumemiru Otome", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/191004.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/191004l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Hanachiru Otome", "Majiwaru Otome", "Oboreru Otome", "Yuugao", "Tonari no Kanojo", "Yogoreta Kanojo", "Natsuyume", "Moonflower", "Soiled Girlfriend", "Girlfriend Next Door"], "en": "Dreaming Maiden", "ja": "\u5922\u898b\u30eb\u4e59\u5973"}, "start_date": "2015-06-26", "end_date": "2016-10-26", "synopsis": "1.

The Prince sees the grim state of the dried-up town and report on it, but Arshtat scorns this; she declares that Lordlake's citizens deserve their desolation for stealing the Dawn Rune. Arshtat's husband Ferid pulls her back to her senses, and she dismisses the inspection party with a whisper.\n\nThe next issue of contention is the Sacred Games for Princess Lymsleia's hand in marriage, being held somewhat early for the ten-year old Lymsleia. The two main contestants, both representing themselves with a champion, hail from rival noble houses: The foppish Euram Barows, and Sialeeds' former fiance, the charismatic Gizel Godwin. The royal family, however, favors the mysterious outsider Belcoot, as a neutral option less likely to cause strife; the Prince attempts to aid Belcoot quietly with Ferid's approval. However, Gizel successfully rigs the Games to his advantage, and his champion Childerich defeats a drugged Belcoot while the Barow's champion is disqualified.\n\nHowever, Lord Marscal Godwin, Gizel's father, is less than impressed with Gizel's activities, thinking that he has made an enemy of the Prince and the royal family as a whole with his plotting. Additionally, the royal family took Zegai, the Barows champion, into their own personal custody, who could perhaps help reveal the Godwins cheating and offer an excuse to annul the engagement. Thus, the Godwins launch a preemptive attack at the engagement ceremony in Sol-Falena, Falena's capital. Arshtat and Ferid had anticipated and prepared for the attack, but not the involvement of the elite Nether Gate assassins, who overwhelm the palace's defenses. The struggle culminates in Arshtat and Ferid's deaths, while Lymsleia finds herself a captive.

That was the beginning of it all...\n\nThe story of this boy, who has become one with a demonic weapon and is drawn into a cruel fate in which he must face countless battles, can be seen as either the story of \"a beautiful weapon and an ugly person\" or of \"the cruelty of weapons and the beauty of humans.\" This is a completely new world of comic noir.\n\n(Source: MU)", "rank": 41067, "popularity": 14122, "num_list_users": 962, "num_scoring_users": 93, "num_favorites": 4, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-17T18:32:58+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 6, "num_chapters": 33, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 7173, "first_name": "Toshiki", "last_name": "Inoue"}, "role": "Story"}, {"node": {"id": 19257, "first_name": "Wosamu", "last_name": "Kine"}, "role": "Art"}]}, {"id": 21338, "title": "Raubritter*", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/34644.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/34644l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc"}, "start_date": "2010-07-17", "end_date": "2010-07-17", "synopsis": "Three years ago, Karamura Neneko's father died.

Not only that, but she quit her job at a company that she had been at for a long time.\n\nWorried about her sister, she remembers a place that her father told her to go to if she was ever in trouble, the Raubritter. Upon arrival, she meets Shinobu and Yokana, cousins that run a detective agency, more-so as a hobby than a career. Since they are both fairly wealthy they never ask for payment. They only help young maidens in need, and since their business is a secret, only people with connections come to them. It turns out that Neneko's father helped them out a lot in the past. The cousins are heart broken to find out that he died, so they are more than willing to help Neneko find her sister.\n\nWhat has happened to Neneko's sister? Will a special relationship develop between Neneko and the cousins?\n\n(Source: MU)", "mean": 6.53, "popularity": 6528, "num_list_users": 2670, "num_scoring_users": 1550, "num_favorites": 4, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 49, "name": "Erotica"}, {"id": 26, "name": "Girls Love"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-02-13T22:25:12+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 7, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 12807, "first_name": "Nika", "last_name": "Saida"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 24410, "title": "Boku no Shiranai Kanojo no Kao", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/49153.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/49153l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Obscene Face of Her Whom I Do Not Know", "I Will Protect You", "Confession from Beyond the Mirror", "Master-Servant Relationship", "Sweet Predator", "Fresh Juice", "Welcome!"], "en": "", "ja": "\u50d5\u306e\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u5f7c\u5973\u306e\u6deb\u8c8c"}, "start_date": "2007-10-29", "end_date": "2010-09-17", "synopsis": "1-3.
