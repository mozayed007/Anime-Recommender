There, Alice Keating is a renowned witch with budding potential\u2014having already mastered most types of magic. When new student Mari Muguruma, who has no experience with witches and magic, is transferred to the school, Alice is given the task of educating her on everything she needs to know.\n\nHaving shown no aptitude towards anything she is taught, Alice struggles to see any worth in Mari. Yet, following an emotional outburst, Mari subconsciously uses her magic on something that requires a vast amount of skill: resurrection magic. Finally able to see why she was brought to the school, Alice dedicates more of her time to teaching Mari. But with Alice focusing so much attention on her, Alice's friends begin to get jealous; and it seems that they are willing to do anything to get rid of Mari.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.01, "rank": 8337, "popularity": 8354, "num_list_users": 1984, "num_scoring_users": 545, "num_favorites": 9, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 26, "name": "Girls Love"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Josei"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-04-14T18:27:15+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 3, "num_chapters": 13, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 7672, "first_name": "", "last_name": "KUJIRA"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 4308, "title": "Ikenai Teacher\u2606Iketeru Darling", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/5/28437.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/5/28437l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Bad Teacher, Good Darling"], "en": "", "ja": "\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u2606\u30a4\u30b1\u3066\u308b\u30c0\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3"}, "start_date": "2003", "end_date": "2003", "synopsis": "Meet Izumi and Tachibana who are right in the middle of a very hot and heavy romance.

In return for rescuing a little fox-spirit creature before school that day, the goddess offers to grant a single wish of Inari's. Without thinking, she blurts out that she wants to be Sumizome. As one might expect, this wish does not go nearly as well as Inari had hoped, and the kindly goddess breaks a goddess-rule to give Inari the ability to change herself back. Now, Inari can change her own shape at will, and using her new skill is very tempting as she keeps trying to win Tanbabashi's heart.
