Their only means of uncovering these memories is by pressing their butterfly-shaped birthmarks together, but the visions they see do not always match.\n\nBelieving Kanoko to be his destined lover, Tsubame wants her to be his girlfriend, but Kanoko has a strong suspicion that it is her sister that he is looking for. The vision Kanoko and Tsubame share begins to complicate itself as more people with the same birthmark appear, weaving a complex tale that binds a group of friends to a tragic past. With only faint glimpses into the events that happened centuries ago, they have to decide whether to pursue their star-crossed lovers or reject their own predetermined fates.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.42, "rank": 3455, "popularity": 8306, "num_list_users": 1994, "num_scoring_users": 691, "num_favorites": 8, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-01T17:55:47+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 6, "num_chapters": 30, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 2774, "first_name": "Toru", "last_name": "Fujieda"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 147137, "title": "Ataerareta Skill wo Tsukatte Kasei de Isekai Bijo-tachi to Ichaicha shitai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/260897.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/260897l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u4e0e\u3048\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u7a3c\u3044\u3067\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u7f8e\u5973\u9054\u3068\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u3057\u305f\u3044"}, "start_date": "2021-12-25", "synopsis": "", "mean": 6.48, "popularity": 11062, "num_list_users": 1367, "num_scoring_users": 321, "num_favorites": 8, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 49, "name": "Erotica"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 62, "name": "Isekai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-05-26T10:13:51+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "currently_publishing", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3300, "first_name": "Rikako", "last_name": "Inomoto"}, "role": "Art"}, {"node": {"id": 58275, "first_name": "Shun", "last_name": "Renki"}, "role": "Story"}]}, {"id": 120769, "title": "Fate Makes No Mistakes", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/272322.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/272322l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Dokkaebido Supul-i Isseoya Moinda"], "en": "Fate Makes No Mistakes", "ja": "\ub3c4\uae68\ube44\ub3c4 \uc218\ud480\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ubaa8\uc778\ub2e4"}, "start_date": "2019-02-07", "synopsis": "Eunjae's been losing sleep from some decidedly disturbing dreams: some kind of otherworldly being keeps having its way with him in the middle of the night.
