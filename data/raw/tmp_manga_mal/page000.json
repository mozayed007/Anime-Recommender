Because of their unrelenting abuse toward each other and the planet, this time the gods vote unanimously in favor of ending the human race.\n\nBut before the mandate passes, Brunhild, one of the 13 demigod Valkyries, puts forth an alternate proposal: rather than anticlimactically annihilating mankind, why not give them a fighting chance and enact Ragnar\u00f6k, a one-on-one showdown between man and god? Spurred on by the audacity of the challenge, the divine council quickly accepts, fully confident that this contest will display the utter might of the gods. To stand a chance against the mighty heavens, Brunhild will need to assemble history's greatest individuals, otherwise the death knell will surely be sounded for mankind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.11, "rank": 538, "popularity": 83, "num_list_users": 126332, "num_scoring_users": 53301, "num_favorites": 5604, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 6, "name": "Mythology"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Seinen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-05-09T16:12:13+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "currently_publishing", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 10563, "first_name": "Takumi", "last_name": "Fukui"}, "role": "Story"}, {"node": {"id": 22491, "first_name": "Shinya", "last_name": "Umemura"}, "role": "Story"}, {"node": {"id": 47050, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Ajichika"}, "role": "Art"}]}, {"id": 56529, "title": "Bungou Stray Dogs", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/100769.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/100769l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Bungo Stray Dogs", "ja": "\u6587\u8c6a\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30c3\u30b0\u30b9"}, "start_date": "2012-12-04", "synopsis": "Atsushi Nakajima is on the brink of death after being kicked out of his orphanage.

Braving the rough terrain of Hokkaido, Sugimoto is now searching for gold in order to keep a promise to his lost brother-in-arms. His efforts have been fruitless for a long time until a mysterious traveler tells him of an urban legend that would rid him of all his troubles.\n\nAccording to the legend, a criminal stole the gold of the Ainu, the indigenous people of Hokkaido, and hid it away in a location that can only be found when a map\u2014made not from pieces of parchment, but the tattooed skins of escaped convicts\u2014is brought together.\n\nUpon meeting with a young Ainu girl, Asirpa, Sugimoto sets off in search of the tattooed prisoners, but many dangers await as soldiers and mercenaries seek the gold as well. Aided by Asirpa's knowledge of the lands, the two of them depart to find the stolen Ainu gold in a journey of revenge, murder, and greed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.63, "rank": 73, "popularity": 155, "num_list_users": 84851, "num_scoring_users": 22343, "num_favorites": 4858, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 46, "name": "Award Winning"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Seinen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-01-01T20:11:40+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 31, "num_chapters": 314, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 34371, "first_name": "Satoru", "last_name": "Noda"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 11734, "title": "Watashitachi no Shiawase na Jikan", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/66993.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/66993l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Watashi-tachi no Shiawase na Jikan", "Our Happy Hours", "Our Happy Time"], "en": "", "ja": "\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306e\u5e78\u305b\u306a\u6642\u9593"}, "start_date": "2008-03-28", "end_date": "2008-08-22", "synopsis": "They wanted to die for their own reasons.\n\nJuri Mutou is the daughter of a once-famous pianist whose career came to an end after giving birth to her.

It's all an act of deception; she is really the self-confessed 'queen of vanity,' and her only goal in life is winning the praise and admiration of everyone around her.\n\nWhen she enters high school, she finally meets her match: Souichirou Arima, a handsome, athletic, popular, and very intelligent young boy. Ever since he stole the top seat in the class from her, Yukino has hated him, and has been plotting on how to take back her former place as the object of all other students' admiration.\n\nWhat she wasn't expecting, however, was that Souichirou, the very boy she hated, would confess his love for her. Or that he would find out about her deception\u2014and use it to blackmail her!\n\nTogether, they discover that they have more in common than they knew, and they slowly begin to bring out each other's inner selves.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Tora to Chameleon: Yakusoku wa Isshukan (The Tiger and the Chameleon: A Promise for One Week)\nVolume 4: Ashita Mata Mori de Aou ne (Meet Me Again Tomorrow in the Forest)\nVolume 8: Abareru Ousama (The Raging King)", "mean": 8.16, "rank": 457, "popularity": 426, "num_list_users": 37398, "num_scoring_users": 13915, "num_favorites": 1602, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-09-01T11:19:13+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 21, "num_chapters": 108, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 1885, "first_name": "Masami", "last_name": "Tsuda"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 10573, "title": "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Onodera Ritsu no Baai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/279878.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/279878l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["World's Greatest First Love: Ritsu Onodera's Affair", "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Yukina Kou no Baai"], "en": "The World's Greatest First Love: The Case of Ritsu Onodera", "ja": "\u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u521d\u604b \uff5e\u5c0f\u91ce\u5bfa\u5f8b\u306e\u5834\u5408\uff5e"}, "start_date": "2006-10-13", "synopsis": "Ritsu Onodera's dream is to edit Japan's bestselling novels, which makes Marukawa Publishing the best place to fulfill his goal.
