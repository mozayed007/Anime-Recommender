Her pet cat and constant companion, Lily, spies the fish that the princess threw out the window and proceeds to eat the entire fish, thus swallowing the ring. Since Princess Flora has declared that whichever of her suitors successfully returns the ring to her shall become her husband, the princess's suitors and Phoenix immediately fan out all over the city pursuing Lily and her owner, Honey Honey.\n\nPhoenix catches up with Honey and Lily and helps them hide from the princess's suitors. Honey proceeds to tell the handsome jewel thief the story of how she was orphaned and brought up in a convent, and of how she befriended Lily, who, like her, was abandoned. Phoenix then tries to persuade Honey to sell Lily to him, but Honey, who is still unaware that Lily has swallowed the princess's ring, furiously refuses and immediately flees. Honey and Lily hide in the basket of a hot-air balloon, which soon lifts off with Phoenix and Princess Flora's suitors still in hot pursuit. Thus begins an adventure in which Honey and Lily are pursued by Phoenix, Princess Flora, and her suitors to various cities around the world, including Paris, New York City, Oslo, London, Monte Carlo and Gibraltar. Along the way, Honey falls in love with Phoenix and tries to keep Lily out of the clutches of the selfish, vain princess...\nFrom: Mangaupdates", "rank": 0, "popularity": 0, "num_list_users": 0, "num_scoring_users": 0, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 6216, "first_name": "Hideko", "last_name": "Mizuno"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 113847, "title": "Sono Apartment, Zashiki Warashi Tsuki Bukken ni Tsuki...", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/225750.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/225750l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["A Zashikiwarashi Lives in that Apartment"], "en": "Because the apartment, with the Zashikiwarashi", "ja": "\u305d\u306e\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3001\u5ea7\u6577\u7ae5\u5b50\u4ed8\u304d\u7269\u4ef6\u306b\u3064\u304d\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb"}, "start_date": "2016-10-11", "synopsis": "32-year-old Ryuutaro Saeki is divorced and returns to living alone again.

However, a little problem of his has followed him to the big city: he's too sensitive, and a quick-draw in the bedroom. With that in the way, the college life he envisioned is nothing but a pipe dream. Chihiro opens up to his neighbor Kota, to which his new friend responds, \"If you just get used to feeling good, you won't be as sensitive to it, right?\" Before Chihiro knows what's happening, Kota kisses him and begins \"sensitivity training\" straight away! Sure, Kota is a more experienced and knowledgeable city boy, but does this normally happen between two guys!? Between a hook like \"You wanna be able to do it with a girl, right?\" and Kota's training methods, Chihiro can't resist! Sparks begin to fly between a sexy city boy and a straight country bumpkin!\n\n(Source: Renta!)", "mean": 6.87, "popularity": 22246, "num_list_users": 435, "num_scoring_users": 164, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 49, "name": "Erotica"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-02-01T03:56:17+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 7, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 50524, "first_name": "Chitose", "last_name": "Yuu"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 120503, "title": "Fude to Kizu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/219645.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/219645l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Brush and Scars"], "en": "", "ja": "\u7b46\u3068\u75b5"}, "start_date": "2018-11-29", "end_date": "2018-11-29", "synopsis": "Takesuke, an artist that specializes in youkai art, met a young woman with a scar on her face.\n\n(Source: Anata no Motokare)", "rank": 31301, "popularity": 40132, "num_list_users": 108, "num_scoring_users": 54, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Seinen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-08-30T20:16:32+00:00", "media_type": "one_shot", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 1, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 39307, "first_name": "Katana", "last_name": "Sajima"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 121271, "title": "Kori goku kou wa seijo o ubau", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/220912.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/220912l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u6c37\u7344\u516c\u306f\u8056\u5973\u3092\u596a\u3046"}, "start_date": "2018-11-10", "end_date": "2018-11-10", "synopsis": "", "rank": 0, "popularity": 0, "num_list_users": 0, "num_scoring_users": 0, "num_favorites": 0, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 42, "name": "Josei"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "media_type": "light_novel", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 0}, {"id": 55991, "title": "09Summer", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/97567.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/97567l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "09Summer"}, "start_date": "2009-08-16", "end_date": "2009-08-16", "synopsis": "Miyo-chan seems a bit sad, always spacing out and is feeling thirsty, making everyone around her worried a little.
