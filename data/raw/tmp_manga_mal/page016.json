Shuu and Reiji are sons of Beatrice; Ayato, Kanato, and Laito are sons of Cordelia; and Subaru is the only child of Christa. The wives engaged in power struggles to gain favor with Karlheinz, and as a result, their children often suffered the physical and psychological consequences of that in-fighting.\n\nThe stories about Cordelia, in particular, strike a chord with Yui. She is uncertain why the mention of that woman affects her strangely or why her heart beats more erratically every day. Unknowingly, she carries a secret within her body that explains why her blood is so delicious to vampires as well as the nature of her familial ties to the Sakamakis.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 6.72, "rank": 12300, "popularity": 10684, "num_list_users": 1429, "num_scoring_users": 499, "num_favorites": 11, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Vampire"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-04T17:54:11+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 6, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 21443, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Carawey"}, "role": "Story & Art"}, {"node": {"id": 21445, "first_name": "Papiko", "last_name": "Nanjou"}, "role": "Story & Art"}, {"node": {"id": 21447, "first_name": "Masaki", "last_name": "Shinoda"}, "role": "Story & Art"}, {"node": {"id": 21449, "first_name": "Shina", "last_name": "Suzaka"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 44569, "title": "Maou na Anoko to Murabito A", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/164738.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/164738l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Maou na Ano Ko to Murabito A", "A Villager and a Devil Girl"], "en": "", "ja": "\u9b54\u738b\u306a\u3042\u306e\u5a18\u3068\u6751\u4ebaA"}, "start_date": "2012-02-27", "end_date": "2015-07-27", "synopsis": "A lonely \"demon lord\" and a self-centered \"hero\"!?\n\nWhat about \"villager A,\" caught in the middle!?\n\nThis is a school that prepares people for roles in fantasy stories.
