The 6th iteration of this tournament is by no means different in such aspects; however, \"family feud\" is a little bit of an understatement when we look at the full-scale world war that is being waged between the corporations led by Kazuya Mishima (father) and Jin Kazama (son). \n\nThe story of the manga focuses on this feud, but through the perspective of Asuka Kazama, a meddlesome girl that likes to prevent conflict and punishes evil doers using her family-inherited Kazama Ryuu kobujutsu. Her strong sense of justice forces her to take a stand against the chaos that her cousin, Jin Kazama, is wrecking at a worldwide scale. Asuka is virtually a town hero in Osaka and is know for having little patience, so \"saving the world\" by smacking Jin around sounds right around her area of speciality. \n\nUnfortunately for Asuka, before she can properly engage in her destined battle, she happens to stumble into Lili Rochefort, her self-proclaimed rival who is in desperate need of a bloody rematch to avenge a humiliating lost to Asuka in the previous tournament. Lili will certainly not budge at anything before having her sweet victory against the Kazama style and will follow Asuka everywhere until she can achieve this. And just like that, Asuka's \"world rescue plan\" gets overshadowed by the necessity of getting Lili out of her life, without totally demolishing every bone of her \"only daughter of rich father\", \"spoiled egoistic sadist princess\", sweet little body. \n\nHave the bonds of an unlikely friendship just been formed? \n\n(Source: MU) ", "mean": 6.62, "rank": 13529, "popularity": 16495, "num_list_users": 748, "num_scoring_users": 345, "num_favorites": 31, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Martial Arts"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-10-24T11:06:15+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 11, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3170, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Bandai-Namco"}, "role": "Story"}, {"node": {"id": 5264, "first_name": "Rui", "last_name": "Takatou"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 125039, "title": "Eiyuuou, Bu wo Kiwameru Tame Tenseisu: Soshite, Sekai Saikyou no Minarai Kishi\u2640", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/239983.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/239983l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["The King of Heroes reincarnates to polish his skill to the limit and becomes the strongest knight in training in the world\u2640"], "en": "Reborn to Master the Blade: From Hero-King to Extraordinary Squire \u2640", "ja": "\u82f1\u96c4\u738b\u3001\u6b66\u3092\u6975\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u8ee2\u751f\u3059 \uff5e\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5f37\u306e\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\u9a0e\u58eb\u2640\uff5e"}, "start_date": "2019-12-06", "synopsis": "King Inglis, who lived for his country and people, strongly hopes that in his next life, \"I want to further temper my skills as a knight.\" The wish is heard by the goddess who reincarnates the king into the far future but in the form of a cute girl!

He was fathered by Shiro and mothered by Yamabuki. Shiro's owner, Gohei, pays no attention to Riki when he comes to pick a pup from the litter. Instead, Riki is never rehomed and becomes close to his mother. Unfortunately, Yamabuki's true owner, who had been sick, was healthy enough to take her back. She didn't feel she could handle two dogs, and decided that he would not take Riki in. Riki severely missed his mother, and one day set out to meet her. On his way, he is attacked by a pack of dogs. Hopelessly outnumbered, Riki tries to escape and falls into a river. Waking up, he learns that his father, Shiro, has rescued him. Riki had never seen his father, but had known his name. Shiro, on the other hand, didn't know that Riki was his son and left before Riki could say anything. But, not before giving him a speech on being strong. Riki makes it his goal and constantly tries to get stronger.\n\nOne day, a child named Daisuke takes a toy car (one children can ride in) through a roaded mountain pass with an incline. Riki, while traveling to see his mother, notices him racing down. A truck, not seeing Daisuke, hits the boy and sends him flying over the road railing. Afraid that he is dead, the driver moves on. Daisuke, although only bruised, is knocked out. Riki jumps onto a ledge and howls, hopeing someone would hear. Instead, the pack that attacked him heard him and came. After being abused, the pack came to hate humans and attacked Daisuke. Riki, in an effort to save him, fought against the dogs and succeeded in winning. Gohei and Shiro eventually showed up, and the pack ran off. Shiro finally found out that Riki was his son.\n\nGohei, Shiro, and a few others head out to fight Akakabuto. Seeing this, Riki follows the van. Gohei intends to kill Akakabuto, but the bear is too strong. Gohei shot the bear in the eye, and the bullet became lodged in the beast's brain. This made him go insane and, while biting Shiro, fall over a cliff. Riki witnessed all this, and was distraught when his father fell. These events set the stage for the future series, Ginga Nagareboshi Gin.\n(source: Wikipedia)", "mean": 7.57, "rank": 2378, "popularity": 10531, "num_list_users": 1457, "num_scoring_users": 751, "num_favorites": 28, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 51, "name": "Anthropomorphic"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-25T20:47:19+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 6, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3173, "first_name": "Yoshihiro", "last_name": "Takahashi"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 10183, "title": "xxxHOLiC: AnotherHOLiC", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/268984.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/268984l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["xxxHolic Another Holic: Landolt-Ring Aerosol", "xxxHoLic: Another Holic Randoruto-kan Aerosol"], "en": "xxxHOLiC: AnotherHOLiC", "ja": "\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7HOLiC \u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\u30db\u30ea\u30c3\u30af \u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30c8\u74b0\u30a8\u30a2\u30ed\u30be\u30eb"}, "start_date": "2006-08-01", "end_date": "2006-08-01", "synopsis": "Nothing could have thrilled Kimihiro more than stumbling upon the bizarre wish-granting shop of the beautiful but unnerving Y\u00fbko Ichihara, who solemnly promises to make the spirits plaguing Kimihiro go away just as soon as her fee\u2013rendered in daily afternoon chores at her shop\u2013is paid in full.\n\nOf course, the thrill wears off as soon as Kimihiro realizes that his payment plan bears a disturbing resemblance to indentured servitude . . . eternal indentured servitude.
