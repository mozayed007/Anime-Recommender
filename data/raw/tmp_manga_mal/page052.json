Mina is a high school freshman with a crush on her math teacher...who also happens to be her cousin Yukiya! Mina has always been very precious to Yukiya, and at times it seems like he can see straight through to her heart, but can he ever see her as a woman and not just his cute little cousin? How long can Mina's flirtations go unnoticed by Yukiya (or by the sadistic and lascivious chemistry teacher, for that matter)?\n\n2) A Vampire at My Neck (Kubisuji ni Banpaia). Be careful when you go groping in the dark...you might just find a vampire! That's what happens to Hitomi. Now she's attracted to Kairi despite what he is. Or is it because of what he is? Kairi has a powerful charm...but is he too charming? Dangerously charming?\n\n3) Hold Me, Melt Me (Dakishimete Tokashite) Ryou is a high school sprinter who's racing for a different kind of goal--his pretty track manager, Airi! He says he wants chocolate from her on Valentine's Day, but...is that a delicious metaphor for something sweeter? Whatever the case, it melts in the mouth!\n\n4) Examine Me Gently (Yasashiku Mite ne). Sanae just had her appendix removed. But while she waits in post-op for her surgery wound to heal, she starts to develop another malady--love sickness! And her handsome new attending physician, Dr. Touya, is the cause! What can cure Sanae's ailment? ...A sponge bath, maybe? \n\nOmake: If you have ever wondered why Shinjo Mayu's female characters have such big breasts and why her heroines seem so young...then you must read this omake!

Unfortunately, this also makes him easy prey to the many enemies he has made throughout his career. Instead of going in hiding, however, Evan decides to hole up at his press office - not the safest place for a man in Evan's situation. Unwilling to have his star reporter remain so vulnerable to attack, the Editor-in-Chief orders Evan to cover an out-of-state story: \"real\" ghost sightings in a secluded village in the countryside\u2014an article too absurd to be handled by the New York Times. For lack of a better thing to do, Evan decides to  follow his editor's orders and drives across the Midwestern desert searching for a town nobody seems to have heard of. After ten days of driving by sleepy rural villages with zero results, our lost and exhausted New Yorker is just about ready to give up. But then suddenly, a road sign pointing to \"Roureville\" catches his eye, and he heaves a sigh of relief. Little does he know that the end of his long road trip is just the beginning of an incredible tale.\n\n(Source: Netcomics)", "mean": 7.1, "rank": 7079, "popularity": 24772, "num_list_users": 352, "num_scoring_users": 141, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2010-05-20T23:54:52+00:00", "media_type": "manhwa", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 3, "num_chapters": 24, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3238, "first_name": "E.", "last_name": "Hae"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 132999, "title": "Tensei shitara Heishi Datta?!: Zankoku no Fukushuusha", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/252098.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/252098l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Tensei shitara Heishi Datta?!: Akai Shinigami to Yobareta Otoko", "When I Reincarnated I Was a Soldier?!: A Man Called the Red Shinigami"], "en": "", "ja": "\u8ee2\u751f\u3057\u305f\u3089\u5175\u58eb\u3060\u3063\u305f?! \u6b8b\u523b\u306e\u5fa9\u8b90\u8005"}, "start_date": "2021-01-14", "end_date": "2022-07-07", "synopsis": "", "mean": 6.48, "rank": 15097, "popularity": 15899, "num_list_users": 798, "num_scoring_users": 214, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 62, "name": "Isekai"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 73, "name": "Reincarnation"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-09-10T13:05:10+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 10, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 45488, "first_name": "Megico", "last_name": "Saki"}, "role": "Art"}, {"node": {"id": 53469, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Shiriken"}, "role": "Story"}]}, {"id": 3463, "title": "Milk to Vitamin", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/3843.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/3843l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Milk & Vitamin", "Milk and Vitamin"], "en": "", "ja": "\u30df\u30eb\u30af\u3068\u30d3\u30bf\u30df\u30f3"}, "start_date": "1997", "synopsis": "Milk is a young and childish girl living with her aunt in Orange Town.

Frey, who kept staring me, tried to grab my suitcase. Taken aback, I held onto it tightly. In return, I heard a refreshing, clear laugh.\n\n\"Let me hold it for you.\"\n\"No, I'm fine.\"\n\"Why? Oh, I get it. You're trying to escape. Am I getting in your way?\"\n\nThe hand holding the suitcase flinched. As he looked at me with an eerie smile, he looked exceedingly dangerous the more he stared. There was ice glistening behind his golden irises.\n\n\"You thought I wouldn't know,\" his large hand wrapped around mine and held the suitcase handle tightly, \"Just to avoid me and that bastard, you're trying to run away.\" His harsh words didn't match his aloof expression. \"It'll spell trouble, Yuni. If you disappear from my sight.\" The gentle and feeble, sickly prisoner suddenly had became an obsessive yandere himself.\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)", "rank": 26523, "popularity": 19931, "num_list_users": 540, "num_scoring_users": 73, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 62, "name": "Isekai"}, {"id": 73, "name": "Reincarnation"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-11-21T23:15:54+00:00", "media_type": "manhwa", "status": "currently_publishing", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 60000, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Apple"}, "role": "Art"}, {"node": {"id": 60001, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Ahntammi"}, "role": "Story"}]}, {"id": 90250, "title": "Kiss and Ride", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/158243.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/158243l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30ad\u30b9\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9"}, "start_date": "2014-08-23", "end_date": "2015-06-24", "synopsis": "", "rank": 34468, "popularity": 41576, "num_list_users": 98, "num_scoring_users": 10, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2015-06-30T18:20:43+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 10, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 36509, "first_name": "Yoshie", "last_name": "Kaoruhara"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 156298, "title": "Reiton ky\u014dju to samayoeru shiro", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/277448.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/277448l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Professor Layton"], "en": "Professor Layton and the Wandering Castle", "ja": "\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30f3\u6559\u6388\u3068\u3055\u307e\u3088\u3048\u308b\u57ce"}, "start_date": "2008-12-19", "synopsis": "The people of London have witnessed an enormous castle floating in the sky.

Training\nThis is a short colored one-shot. The older sister treats her younger brother like a dog.\n\n2-4. A Sexual Molester\nThis short story starts out with a kid riding on the train to school. As usual, the train is packed and he is rubbing up against a woman in front of him. Painfully aware that he is getting hard, he rushes off the train only to be stopped by the woman who then forces him into a restroom and accuses him of groping. She then makes him pay for his actions by using him like a piece of meat. He eventually becomes her (and her boss') sex slave.\n\n5. The Aunt\nTsuyoshi's aunt, Azuma, loves to come over to his house and touch him in inappropriate places. On the outside, he puts up a front that he doesn't like it but deep down he actually does. One day when his aunt comes over, he tells her to stay in the living room while he goes to his room to study. Realizing that he has a massive erection just from looking at his aunt, he tries to relieve himself but is caught by his aunt, of course.\n\n6. I Don't Like Cigarettes\nRokujo finds a pack of cigarettes on the ground and notices that they're the same kind that his mother likes. As he puts one of them in his mouth to taste, he is caught by his PE Instructor, Kurokawa-sensei. Afraid that she'll tell his parents that he smokes, he offers to accept any punishment. Kurokawa-sensei obviously takes advantage of this... (This one-shot has a sequel in Ero Ane)\n\n7. Lascivious Liar\nKazuyoshi's sister is staying home today because she is feeling ill. Wanting to be a good brother, he brings her breakfast before heading off to school. As he starts to leave, his sister asks him to check her temperature by touching foreheads. As he leans in, his sister tazes him. When Kazuyoshi regains consciousness, he realizes that he is tied up. I am sure you can imagine what happens from there...\n\n(Source: BakaBT)", "mean": 6.56, "popularity": 26403, "num_list_users": 305, "num_scoring_users": 119, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2017-03-18T18:12:35+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 7, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 11901, "first_name": "Saburou", "last_name": "Dakouin"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}]
