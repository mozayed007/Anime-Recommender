The manga depicts their relationships -- both sexual and emotional -- with unabashed honesty. While the story practically explodes off the page with a continuous, unremitting and glorious parade of smut, it isn't \"meaningless sex\" -- these are committed couples in full-time relationships, where pleasure and pain are natural expressions of affection for one another. (You guessed it; that's where the manga's name comes from. They're \"partners.\")\n\nThe six friends that star in this manga are split up into three pairs. The main pair consists of Marlon and Doug, around whose relationship the manga revolves. Marlon, a high-flying executive, plays sub and devoted masochist to the beautifully dominant Doug. Doug is, interestingly enough, a janitor at the very company Marlon directs; during the average workday, they barely even make eye-contact. The contrast between their private and public lives is as stark as it is lovely. The other couples also feature in major roles, and what we end up with is an intimate and moving glimpse at an otherwise unconventional lifestyle.\n\n(Source: The Pink Panzer)", "mean": 6.38, "popularity": 19880, "num_list_users": 542, "num_scoring_users": 250, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 49, "name": "Erotica"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-06-05T15:06:01+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 5, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 5968, "first_name": "Tamaki", "last_name": "Yura"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 145225, "title": "Hana Ikeru Doutei-kun", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/257416.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/257416l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Flower Loving Virgin", "ja": "\u82b1\u751f\u3051\u308b\u7ae5\u8c9e\u304f\u3093"}, "start_date": "2017", "end_date": "2017", "synopsis": "\"Tsujido Ei, who is a flower arranger, has struggled living with his step-brother, Natsuki, who he has strong feelings for.\nBut trying to be the \"Good Younger Brother\" is starting to become harder as Natsuki keeps feeling skin on skin.\nOut of no where Natsuki in just underwear, hugs onto me, he smells so amazing.\n\"As your older brother, I'll take the responsibility of protecting you...\" wait is this a delusion?!\nA love comedy that makes the family relationship go crazy!!\u201d\n\n(Source: Manga.club)", "rank": 0, "popularity": 0, "num_list_users": 0, "num_scoring_users": 0, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 49, "name": "Erotica"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 0}, {"id": 14409, "title": "Angetsuyakou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/20601.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/20601l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Angetsu Yakou"], "en": "", "ja": "\u95c7\u6708\u591c\u884c"}, "start_date": "2007-10", "synopsis": "", "rank": 19924, "popularity": 43735, "num_list_users": 85, "num_scoring_users": 6, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2011-04-10T20:25:34+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 7908, "first_name": "Munku", "last_name": "Mutsuki"}, "role": "Art"}, {"node": {"id": 7909, "first_name": "En", "last_name": "Aoi"}, "role": "Story"}]}, {"id": 145481, "title": "Yonayonayona", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/4/270920.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/4/270920l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Every Every Night", "ja": "\u591c\u306a\u591c\u306a\u591c\u306a"}, "start_date": "2021-04-20", "synopsis": "", "rank": 25604, "popularity": 34442, "num_list_users": 160, "num_scoring_users": 17, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-10-28T13:43:59+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "currently_publishing", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 50559, "first_name": "Kouhei", "last_name": "Shibata"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 147529, "title": "Kuroki Kemono wa Ai ni Otsu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/261706.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/261706l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["The Black Beast Falls in Love.", "The Black Beast's Descent Into Love"], "en": "A Beast's Descent Into Love", "ja": "\u9ed2\u304d\u7363\u306f\u611b\u306b\u843d\u3064"}, "start_date": "2020-06-19", "end_date": "2021-02-19", "synopsis": "When thief Karim sneaks into a clandestine auction, he finds Asena, a beautiful young man with animal ears and a tail.

Unfortunately a Zaku II begis to open fire on the area of the ship where Professor Minovsky, had been sitting only moments before.\n\nTrenov Y. Minovsky was born in 1983 (U.C. 0015) in the Ural regions near Chernobyl, Ukraine. At age three, Trenov witnesses the Chernobyl Disaster. After moving to America in 1999 (U.C. 0031) he enrolled in school and began research on a fictitious particle known as \"Minovsky Physics\". But at the time his research was far too unrealistic, and no one understood where he was going with it. However, one of his buddies, Ionesco, informs him that Anaheim Electronics has agreed to sponsor his research. He is thrilled at this, much to the chagrin of Ionesco. Shortly thereafter in U.C. 0040, the Minovsky particle is discovered. However, at a scientific conference, it is determined that the Minovsky particle has no relation to nuclear fusion reactors and that his thesis has no conclusive evidence. The reason behind it comes from Ionesco saying that it only has conventional technological applications. Ionesco also refutes Minovsky's research by stating that a particle with a special nature like it was never detected. As of this, he was deemed an impostor and forever banned from the scientific community. A short time later, he is approached by a representative of Zeon Zum Deikun and later moves to Side 3 in U.C. 0045, and around the same time he created a nuclear fusion generator which was then used to create a artificial Sun for the Colony. At the same time, the \"Minovsky Physics Society\" is established and weapons development is started. However, as he becomes increasingly obsessed with weapons development, which leads to his wife leaving him. Following the death of Zeon Zum Deikun in U.C. 0070, Minovsky receives an award for his developments, but tosses it aside in front of the entire Zabi family. From here he goes back to Earth to once again visit what remains his home of Chernobyl.

It was published in a series of three volumes by Gentosha as a supplement (hence the \"Special\" title) to the Neo G\u014dmanism series serialized in \"SAPIO\" magazine from September 1995 onwards. The series has been criticized by numerous people and groups for \"rewriting history\", including intellectuals Satoshi Uesugi, Shinji Miyadai and Takaaki Yoshimoto, The Academy of Outrageous Books, and extending even to the overseas media in newspapers such as \"The New York Times\" and \"Le Monde\". A verbal dispute over the manga's contents with S\u014dichir\u014d Tahara has been published in a book called \"The On War War\".\n\nBesides the ideological criticism, the books have also been found to contain historical errors, clear manipulation of evidence, and illogical arguments. For example, the manga states that \"The lands of Manchuria did not belong to the present-day Chinese people\", although it did not belong to the Japanese either. Also, the manga claims that only Japan remained independent while East Asia was colonized by the West (with a map showing all of Asia, including East, South and South-East Asia), but the independent nation of Siam and the Japanese colonies of Korea and Taiwan are ignored. Another important point is that the manga was mainly intended to agitate young readers with little to no previous historical knowledge of the issue.\n\nThe book may have been named after Carl von Clausewitz' \"On War\" (as both share the Japanese name \"Sens\u014d Ron\"), but otherwise has no relation to it.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "rank": 19499, "popularity": 40362, "num_list_users": 106, "num_scoring_users": 22, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-16T16:44:49+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 3, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 7131, "first_name": "Yoshinori", "last_name": "Kobayashi"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 143692, "title": "Taiyou no Tou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/255057.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/255057l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "Tower of the Sun", "ja": "\u592a\u967d\u306e\u5854"}, "start_date": "2003-12-19", "end_date": "2003-12-19", "synopsis": "One young man's boring college life changes forever when he shares a budding romance with a girl named Mizuo.

Higa is not so young and his art is simple/naive as Aoki, but the power/impact of his works is very strong, too. He was born in Okinawa and has gathered a lot of historical facts, and describes them matter-of-factly, without one-sided interpretation (So his manga is not too bitter because people are tough and brave persons who can offer hopes to people will appear even under the war). In his manga, both a japanese soldier and american one can become an enemy of the people. Higa tries to insist that the war can easily make an ordinary guy into a devil who can mercilessly kill a child or woman (and lynch good soldiers). For the helpless people of Okinawa, the japanese army often became an enemy (Soldiers deprived the people of their civilian shelter, food,,etc) because they were used as a shield for the people of mainland of Japan. Even after the war, they were often raped by US soldiers (and even japanese officers stood by the US army).

Though he reincarnated as a noble's son, he is neither the main character nor the hero of this world. He become someone who didn't even appear in the game. Plus, with only \"Spearmanship\" as his skill, he can't even join the hero party to clear main story. His small advantages are the fact that he became the hero's friend and his father's rather high status. He's nothing but a supporting character of the story.\n\nWelner noted the game story that he knew from his past life, used it, along with his authority and influence as a noble, to survive from demon king army. But, without realizing it, the knowledge from his past life and his memories of the game story affected the world. He saved people that should have died and took care of events that didn't appear in the game. With that, he carved history of this world.\n\nThis is not a story about the hero. This is a story about struggle and effort of a young noble.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)", "rank": 26432, "popularity": 24583, "num_list_users": 357, "num_scoring_users": 66, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 62, "name": "Isekai"}, {"id": 73, "name": "Reincarnation"}, {"id": 80, "name": "Video Game"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-03-22T20:46:48+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "currently_publishing", "num_volumes": 0, "num_chapters": 0, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 60109, "first_name": "Yuuki", "last_name": "Suzuki"}, "role": "Story"}, {"node": {"id": 60111, "first_name": "Ranpei", "last_name": "Ashio"}, "role": "Art"}]}, {"id": 20821, "title": "Umi Monogatari: Anata ga Ite Kureta Koto", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/144947.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/144947l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Sea Story: That You Were There For Me"], "en": "", "ja": "\u3046\u307f\u3082\u306e\u304c\u305f\u308a \u301c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u304c\u3044\u3066\u304f\u308c\u305f\u30b3\u30c8\u301c"}, "start_date": "2009-02-28", "end_date": "2010-01-30", "synopsis": "Marin and her sister Urin live in the sea.
