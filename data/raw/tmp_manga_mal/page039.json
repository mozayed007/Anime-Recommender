He's part of a hardcore delinquent family, and he's supposed to go to their traditional Ichimatsu high school and be the top fighter. Instead, he's secretly attending the high-class Shirayuri high school, as a normal kid. For a while, things seem to be going well. He has the skills of a top fighter, so he just sneaks into Ichimatsu to knock out his competitors. Afterwards, he switches back to his mild-mannered, Art Club president, student council president alter ego. With a little help from a few trusted friends, he's kept the two lives safely separate.\n\nEverything gets a little harder when his little sister Ginko decides to attend Shirayuri high school. Will he be able to keep his identity secret from his own sister, as they attend the same school? And how will he deal with Yayoi, a Shirayuri student with a huge crush on his punk persona? Will he be able to keep up his double life through graduation?\n\n(Source: MU)", "rank": 43659, "popularity": 27952, "num_list_users": 266, "num_scoring_users": 27, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-03T00:57:55+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 15, "num_chapters": 135, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 35557, "first_name": "Toshio", "last_name": "Ozawa"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 148887, "title": "TS\u2606Revolution", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/264185.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/264185l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "TS\u2606Revolution"}, "start_date": "2020-06-05", "end_date": "2022-03-04", "synopsis": "", "popularity": 33878, "num_list_users": 167, "num_scoring_users": 69, "num_favorites": 2, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}, {"id": 65, "name": "Magical Sex Shift"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-07-04T11:36:07+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 5, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 18931, "first_name": "Takuto", "last_name": "Shiki"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 21911, "title": "Kidou Senshi Gundam 00: Aoi Kizuna", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/282852.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/282852l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Mobile Suit Gundam 00 - Bonds", "Mobile Suit Gundam 00 - Ties", "Mobile Suit Gundam 00 - Kizuna", "Mobile Suit Gundam 00 - Aoi Kizuna"], "en": "", "ja": "\u6a5f\u52d5\u6226\u58eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e000 \u84bc\u3044\u7d46"}, "start_date": "2009-02-25", "end_date": "2009-06-25", "synopsis": "The World may be United but the time has come for Celestial Being to begin their interventions again.\nFor all of those who stand up in answer to the call, irreplaceable \"Bonds\" exist.\n\nBonds contains five short stories set throughout the second season, including Soma's transformation into Marie, Sumeragi's return to Celestial Being, and Marina creating her song for Kataron.

Or are they?\n\nShun, a shy transfer student at the local middle school, is a lonely kid who spends his time making a freeware game. He ends up at the Jailhouse after being bullied by a popular and seemingly nice student named Takurou whose father owns the building. As he enters the mansion with Takurou, Shun is joined by his friends, the brainy Hiroshi and Anna, the kindhearted class president. Takurou's lackey, Takeshi, and Takurou's girlfriend Mika also accompany them. But once inside, they are unable to leave, and they come face to face with the blue monsters inhabiting the Jailhouse. But even stranger is the fact that their experiences in the mansion play out just like Shun's game.
