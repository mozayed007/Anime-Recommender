From light-hearted humor, to angst and a taste of the forbidden, each chapter embraces a wide variety of subjects and emotions, exploring the different sexual relationships between eclectic groups of characters. Some of the stories contain elements of bondage, non-con themes, and incest.\n\n1) Crazy For You:\nMizugami is surprised one day when that woman, who was his first and last, suddenly appears after sixteen years and tells him he is a father. Not only that, but his son Yuuri is now his responsibility. Yuuri has always harbored an attraction for his small, cute daddy, and can\u2019t see the man as his father. Can Yuuri help his daddy see beyond the forbidden and accept him as a lover?\n\n2) So, I Know All About It:\nMitomo sleeps with other men for money and as a hobby. Toudou is his childhood friend and wants him to stop, nagging constantly about pride and self-respect. He has always loved Mitomo and has never been with another, wanting to give his first kiss and first experience to his childhood friend. Mitomo knows Toudou is a virgin and taunts him until Toudou finally gives into the seduction, making love for the first time with Mitomo. Just when Toudou thinks that things have changed and all is right in the world, he catches Mitomo with another customer. Can Toudou convince Mitomo to give up his whoring ways?\n\n3) Cute Little Devil:\nIbuki Kaoru is a normal human who keeps 4 demons as pets. The youngest demon, Dooru, is connected to Ibuki because if he doesn\u2019t drink Ibuki\u2019s blood, he can\u2019t survive. Having Dooru drink his blood while he has sex with the demon, fills Ibuki with indescribable pleasure. But at the climax, Dooru always calls the name of another. It makes Ibuki want to bully him. After one particularly harsh punishment, Dooru slips into a coma. Can Ibuki bring the demon back by revealing his true feelings?\n\n4) The Sun and the North Wind:\nSoleil, the sun god, loves Nord, the north wind god. But Nord will have nothing to do with him. The moon god Lune, fed up with the depression in which Soleil has fallen, suggests that the sun god try a different strategy to win over Nord. Soleil challenges the north wind god to a contest, where the winner stands to gain it all. Can the sun god win the game and the heart of the north wind god?\n\n5) Heaven:\nWhat\u2019s the difference between sinful and non-sinful sexual relationships? Is loving someone a sin, even if that person is of the same sex? If wanting to be with the one you love, wishing to share happiness with the one you love is a sin, then why did God give humans bodies of flesh? These are questions that a beautiful priest can not easily answer when pressured with sweet temptation. Will he lose his faith to the dark haired demon that taunts him?\n\n6) Display House:\nTakayuki Mukai lives in the corporate dorms directly across from Meguru Esaka\u2019s home. Meguru is a voyeur, watching Takayuki entertain his guests, and slowly developing feelings for the other man. He uses his knowledge to blackmail Takayuki into giving him shows on a regular basis, having sex with random strangers in the window so that Meguru can watch from his room directly next door. Meguru\u2019s goal is to eventually make Takayuki his. In that showroom where Takayuki\u2019s shameful performance unfolds, will he ever realize the love that Meguru has for him?\n\n(from B-U)", "mean": 6.55, "popularity": 20499, "num_list_users": 512, "num_scoring_users": 249, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Boys Love"}, {"id": 49, "name": "Erotica"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2021-01-11T18:10:49+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 6, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3303, "first_name": "", "last_name": "Chi-Ran"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 68063, "title": "Seiteki na Kanojo", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/116439.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/116439l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Wasurena", "Bimyou na Kankei", "Nii Mama", "Present", "Ippo Sagatte Niho Sagatte", "Ane Shiyou", "Little"], "en": "She is Sexual", "ja": "\u6027\u7684\u306a\u5f7c\u5973"}, "start_date": "2005-05-10", "end_date": "2005-05-10", "synopsis": "1.

The civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, as well as the Moon Crystals that could be used to control them. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, which caused enormous environmental harm and threatened the extinction of all six civilizations. The most advanced of the civilizations, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroying the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent the Rains from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away.\n\nIn present time, the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire, led by Empress Teodora, seeks the Moon Crystals in order to awaken the Gigas and take over the world. Valua's will is enforced through the Valuan Armada, a fleet of iron-clad warships led by senior admiral Galcian and vice admiral Ramirez under the authority of the Empress. They are primarily opposed by the Blue Rogues, a faction of Air Pirates who make it a point to harass the Armada as much as possible.

One day, the head of the school is removed due to illness and an extremely logical-minded young man named Kaneda Masumi takes his place. Masumi looks like a businessman, and he starts by making logical economic steps for the school--by dramatically increasing tuition for the following year. Ako doesn't want to ask her grandmother to support her with even more money, and after getting the bottom grade on an assignment, she doesn't think she has a shot at a scholarship. When she breaks down in tears while talking over her options with Kaneda, he treats her with unexpected kindness, telling her to have more faith in herself. Now Ako is determined to work her way into a scholarship position, but she and her friends' ways of thinking still constantly clash with Kaneda's logical view of the world!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)", "rank": 23562, "popularity": 39356, "num_list_users": 114, "num_scoring_users": 14, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2012-12-28T03:24:18+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 2, "num_chapters": 12, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 2490, "first_name": "Yuana", "last_name": "Kazumi"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 40675, "title": "H na Onna no Naisho Banashi: Himitsu no Keijiban", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/71577.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/71577l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\uff28\u306a\u5973\u306e\u5185\u7dd2\u8a71 \uff5e\u79d8\u5bc6\u306e\u63b2\u793a\u677f\uff5e"}, "start_date": "2008-05-23", "end_date": "2008-05-23", "synopsis": "", "popularity": 35240, "num_list_users": 151, "num_scoring_users": 64, "num_favorites": 1, "nsfw": "gray", "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Hentai"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2012-10-21T01:34:20+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 1, "num_chapters": 8, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 3947, "first_name": "Kuniaki", "last_name": "Kitakata"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 114659, "title": "Alice to Taiyou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/213171.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/213171l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Alice and Sun", "Ushinokoku Counter Strike"], "en": "Alice & Taiyo", "ja": "\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u3068\u592a\u967d"}, "start_date": "2018-07-02", "end_date": "2018-11-19", "synopsis": "When an outgoing up-and-coming singer named Alice meets a shy, but talented composer named Taiyou\u2014his life gets turned upside down!
