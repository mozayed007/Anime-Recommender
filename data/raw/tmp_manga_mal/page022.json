Furthermore, Shouta's beetle pet is in fact an insect king, born every hundred million years. As part of Moriking's trial to become the king of all insects, he must venture out into the wider world and survive. In doing so, he quickly recognizes Shouta as his savior and owner, and wishes to remain with the Aikawa family.\n\nAlthough Shouta has no qualms about accepting a humanoid beetle who can fly and walk on walls, his high school sister Shouko does. Somehow persuaded by Shouta's pleas, Shouko and their parents ultimately decide to accept the insect king into their family.

But Ken's rubbed the wrong people the wrong way and dies rather horrifically in a car bomb. As with Al Simmons, who is referenced several times in this first volume, Double K makes a deal with the devil. He'll trade his soul just to be with his sister again. As with any deal with such nefarious creatures, Ken finds himself \"alive\" again seven years later. Dressed in a bizarre costume and sporting incredible power, Ken has a new role to fulfill, that of a Hellspawn. A number of questions are raised about Double K's purpose as a Hellspawn and the possible redemption of the wicked. But like the original Spawn the questions are left unanswered in favor of action and comedy. \n\n(Source: MU)", "mean": 6.86, "rank": 10540, "popularity": 22727, "num_list_users": 419, "num_scoring_users": 108, "num_favorites": 6, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-21T21:10:08+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 3, "num_chapters": 16, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 5752, "first_name": "Juzo", "last_name": "Tokoro"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 9925, "title": "The Delusion Diary", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/13281.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/13281l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Mousou Diary", "Moso Diary"], "en": "", "ja": ""}, "synopsis": "This volume contains 7 stories:\n\n   1.
