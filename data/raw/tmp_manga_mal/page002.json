The sixteen-year-old is heartbroken after his girlfriend moves away. To ease his troubled state, Mugi takes a summer job at his friend Kazuki's beach-side snack bar/hotel on a tropical island. It seems like the perfect plan-until Kazuki sets Mugi up on a date with Yuu, who's supposed to be, well, a little less than perfect. When Yuu arrives, however, she's not the monster that either of the boys had imagined. In fact, Yuu is about the cutest person that Mugi has ever seen. But after Mugi accidentally walks in on Yuu in the bath, the girl is steamed. When trying to apologize the next day, he discovers that Yuu has left the shores of paradise. Mugi vows to search high and low for the beautiful Yuu, but will he ever see her again?\n\n(Source: Del Rey)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 11: Candy Girl ni Hanataba wo.\nVolume 13: Apricot Girl\nVolume 24: Happy Ice Cream\nVolume 34: Otoko wa Sore wo Gaman Dekinai!!\nVolume 42: Weapon!!!", "mean": 7.49, "rank": 2905, "popularity": 1234, "num_list_users": 14378, "num_scoring_users": 4866, "num_favorites": 318, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 9, "name": "Ecchi"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Harem"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2022-03-16T05:48:13+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 44, "num_chapters": 219, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 2396, "first_name": "Toshihiko", "last_name": "Kobayashi"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 395, "title": "Ibara no Ou", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/180829.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/180829l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "King of Thorn", "ja": "\u3044\u3070\u3089\u306e\u738b"}, "start_date": "2002-09-12", "end_date": "2005-09-12", "synopsis": "Two twins, separated by fatal illness and a selective cure.

Once the war ended, an annual tradition was proposed where a female sacrifice would be taken from the humans to be eaten by the King of Beasts. This tradition continues on as the 99th sacrifice, 15-year-old Sariphi, is taken from her village to the kingdom of Ozmargo, a miasma-filled realm where beasts live and human entry is forbidden.\n\nBut Sariphi is not like the previous sacrifices. Her optimism and lack of fear towards the beasts and her fate surprises the otherwise fearsome King. Intrigued by the sacrificial princess and her history, he allows her to freely roam around the kingdom until the night of revelation despite the potential outrage. Little do Sariphi and the King know, their short time spent together has slowly set the stage for something unimaginably different for the future of Ozmargo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.93, "rank": 862, "popularity": 1277, "num_list_users": 13995, "num_scoring_users": 3602, "num_favorites": 254, "nsfw": "white", "genres": [{"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 25, "name": "Shoujo"}], "created_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-05-09T22:53:10+00:00", "media_type": "manga", "status": "finished", "num_volumes": 15, "num_chapters": 89, "authors": [{"node": {"id": 18281, "first_name": "Yuu", "last_name": "Tomofuji"}, "role": "Story & Art"}]}, {"id": 4612, "title": "Needless", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/55177.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/55177l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": [], "en": "", "ja": "\u30cb\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9"}, "start_date": "2003-10-18", "end_date": "2013-06-19", "synopsis": "Year 2130 -- after the third world war, large contaminated areas known as \"Blackspots\" formed all over Japan.
