With her senses heightened by an aphrodisiac, she is subjected to a variety of tortures and sexual pleasures using different instruments. A carnal pleasure she does not desire begins to be imprinted on her slowly trained body to please men. However, her hell continues. How much can the trained ninja Ajisai endure? The kunoichi, whose expression remains unmoved despite the situation, begins to lose control of her body. Even as a ninja, she cannot escape her most primal feminine desire, the pleasure of being penetrated.",

He's never owned a kappa before, so he relies heavily on a book he purchased on the subject of raising and training kappa. The books gives several good tips for bringing up a smart and well behaved kappa, and it all seems very simple. Unfortunately, putting these techniques into practice and actually making them work is not quite as easy as the book implies. Kaatan seems to understand things at first, but usually ends up either forgetting what he's learned, or isn't interested in learning in the first place. However, this particular young man has a lot of patience, and continues his possibly fruitless effort to raise Kaatan into a pet he can be proud of.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

In most of these scenes it involves the Owner giving Shin a speech of sorts or making Shin feel uncomfortable. ",

Headstrong school bad boy Shingo Tamai and his friend Ohira are determined not to be bullied into joining Matsuki's team; instead they set up a squad of their own, and at first play just for fun and struggle to keep up with Matsuki's team. \n\nAs their skills progress, they play other teams and get stronger and craftier, until they face the crack Asakase high school squad and its star player Misugi Yan in the schools' final. In a tangle of subplots involving old rivalries and injuries, and a mixed-race player seeking his identity and his lost mother (who turns out to be in jail), Shingo develops his skills as a center forward and looks forward to playing a visiting Brazilian squad. He is seriously injured in a game, but his talent, which even the legendary Brazilian Pele recognizes, is equaled by his determination. With the help of a friend of his old rival Matsuki, he recovers to help the team to victory. \n\nDefinitely melodrama rather than a sports series proper, this is the first in the line of Japanese soccer soaps that stretches to Captain Tsubasa and beyond. Based on a manga by Ikki Kajiwara and Kosei Sonoda. \n\n(Source: The Anime Ecyclopedia)",

While she rejoices at their reunion, she sees how terribly the curse has affected her brothers and promises to set them free at any cost.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At the same time, Soo-min transfers in from Seoul and Cheol-soo, who dreams of becoming a scientist, come into her life. They are all immature but they are in the midst of youthful aspiration.\n\nWith this warm-hearted animation, Han Hye-jin-I and Ahn Jae-hoon encourage Yi-rang's dreams and portray the fantasy and flutter of adolescence through encounters with good people. Set in the '80s and '90s, an old umbrella and a railroad crossing the downtown in the film is the stuff that reminds us of our lost past, evoking a reminiscence in the audience of that which is vanished.\n\nIt is a way of evoking the real \"dreams\" that we have lost in this modern society where a rapid capitalization is progressing.\n\n(Source: Hancinema)",

The first deals with a group of young women who, after being out of school for a few years, are beginning to think about settling down. However, there is one member of the group who has no prospects, and Shizuka's friends are worried that her shyness will keep Mr. Right from noticing her beauty and character. \n\nThey persuade her to join a dating service called The Wedding Club, but when her first match seems to be quite a dud, Shizuka wonders if a trip down the isle just isn't in her future. The second episode is about five sisters, only one of whom isn't married. What's more, the cool Kiyomi seems to have no interest whatsoever in finding a husband. Her sisters have other ideas, though, and when a co-worker asks her out on a date, the women convince the suitor to propose marriage that very night.This is easier said than done, however, as Kiyomi's attitude can be quite intimidating. \n\nThe young man may not end up following through with the plan, but even if he does there is no guarantee that the headstrong lady in question will say yes. \n\n(Source: All Movie Guide)",

For any hope to avoid such a catastrophe, the kingdom's princess hastily seeks out a hero from Earth capable of wielding the \"Miracle Crayon.\" \n\nWhile the kingdom's reformers arrive on land to seize Earth, the magical crayon finds itself in the hands of Shinnosuke \"Shin-chan\" Nohara. In a journey that will test the limits of childlike imagination, Shin-chan must harness his creativity to secure the safety of his home and restore peace to both worlds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It is inspired by Japanese novelist Murakami Haruki's book 'Sekai no Owari to Hard-Boiled Wonderland' (English title: Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World). The music was done by Tenmon, who's also responsible for the music in Shinkai's 'Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko', 'Hoshi no Koe', and 'Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho'.\n\nOnly 30 seconds long, this short was originally viewable at Shinkai's website, but has since been taken down due to bandwidth issues. Its chances of getting a proper release are slim, as Shinkai intended it only as practice using 3DCG programs. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The designs of footballs and football shoes require detailed information and computer tests in order to produce products that will allow us to reach the full potential and beyond. If we were only reliant on human testing, the standards would definitely fluctuate greatly. Thus, Professor GGO was brought in as consultant in the research, and as a result GGO robotic footballers were created.\n\n(Source: GGO Football Website)",

The \"Good for You\" political party that rose to power without electoral consent has instituted a \"Chocolate Prohibition Law!\" All food and drink that involves chocolate, along with nearly every other enjoyable treat has been outlawed by the new administration.\n\nEnter Huntly and Smudger, two young boys who used to hang around Ms. Bubby's sweets store just to catch a glimpse of the lovely Louise. Since the new law was passed, the store, once a lively place, had become destitute. Louise tips off the boys to a fledgling business involving the distribution of bootlegged chocolate. As they make their way to the secret mine of chocolate ingredients, they come across a mysterious code.\n\nAfter successfully decoding the cipher, the boys enter the illegal dealer's headquarters. Inside, they are pleasantly surprised by the commencement of a Chocolate Party! Hunter and Smudger are blissfully reunited with the taste of chocolate again. But the party is abruptly cut short by the presence of the Chocolate Police. As people flee in all directions the boys' friend Div is captured by the officials!\n\nUnforgivable! All he wanted was a bite of chocolate! What is so wrong about that? Huntley, Smudger, and Louise decide to embark on their own chocolate bootlegging venture. With their combined talents, knowledge and passion, will they be able to reclaim the \"Fun and Beautiful\" world they once inhabited?!\n\n(Source: Eleven Arts)",

They thrust the Ama no Nuboko (heavenly spear) into the sea, and the water droplets falling from the spear become the islands of Japan. Because of the violent actions of her brother Susanoo, the sun goddess Amaterasu retreats and shuts herself in the Ama no Iwato (heavenly cave). The gods gather around the cave and the goddess Ame no Uzume dances in front of it. As Amaterasu peers out to see what is happening, the god Tajikarao pushes open the rock door, bringing forth the glorious light of heaven once again. The golden kite lands on top of the heavenly bow that emerges from among the clouds. The light emanating from the kite repels the evil spirits of Japan. Finally, the three sacred treasures (the sacred sword, jewel, and mirror) emerge.\n\n(Source: Japanese Animation Preservation Project)\n",

After returning home a horrible truth is revealed.... Drawing on an early medieval Japanese legend, the film is reminiscent of the horror psychodrama Kwaidan. The Demon (1972) took awards at many animation festivals. \n\n(Source: kviff.com)",

However, if she does not succeed within one year, she will become as insubstantial as the wind. Down in the village, Yuki is befriended by a group of orphans whose parents have been killed by the bandits and who now subsist by begging. Yuki amazes them by taming the wild horse Blizzard. She is instrumental in getting the orphans and farmers to stand up to first the warring bandits and then Goemon, the greedy lord that owns the region. Yuki must then face her greatest challenge when the displeased Demon God that lives in the volcano emerges to destroy those who live beneath.\n\n(Source: moria.co.nz/fantasy/yuki-snowfairy.htm) ",

Called the \"black box,\" an international organization called \"Project BB\" was created to research it.\n\nEight boys, including Manabu Yoshimura, attend International Academy, a school located near Project BB headquarters. They are enticed by their teacher Toukichi Hashiba's promise of \"I'll give you class credit,\" and end up getting involved in his experiment. The experiment was to enter the eight empty chambers of meteorite. According to Hashiba's theory, the meteorite should strongly respond to strong human thoughts. He tells them to have a clear image of a great looking gigantic robot; if they do, something should happen...\n\nThen, a big spaceship appears in the sky and an alien calling himself Wercury appears in a 3-D image. He tells them he is from the Star of Prokimasi and that he has come to collect the meteorite of the Choshin people. If they do not hand it over, he will challenge the earth beings to a battle. Manabu and his friends are confused by the unexpected turn of events but the meteorite responds to the thoughts of the group and suddenly starts to transform itself into a gigantic robot. Then, attacked by the invading Prokimasi robot, they are forced to pull their strength together and fight back. But it is extremely difficult to put the wills of the eight together as one and the robot cannot fight in the way it should. The gigantic robot that Hashiba named \"Gakusaver\" and Manabu's eight; can they manage to protect Earth and the meteorite from the Prokimasi invasion?\n\n(Source: King Records)",

        "synopsis": "A film produced for Toei's 20th anniversary. A boy who is the descendant of the leader of the theives who met a grisly fate in the 1001 Nights bands together with 38 cats and a mouse to get back his rightful treasure from Ali Baba XXXIII, the descendent of Ali Baba who now rules the kingdom with an iron fist. This is a reversal of the good guy/bad guy roles in the original story! (perhaps not surprising for being a film in which Hayao Miyazaki was involved) This film is one of the most rollicking and action-packed films made by Toei, and is in an outrageously cartoonish style breaking with the Toei mold. It has a spectacular lineup of animators including Yasuji Mori, Akira Daikubara, Hayao Miyazaki, Yoichi Kotabe and Reiko Okuyama. The original story about Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves itself is recounted at one point in the film in an unexpected and interesting way using shadow-puppets. \n\n(Source: pelleas.net) ",

On the excavation, Ray meets Mai and Mami Tachibana, freewheeling pubescent girls who heedlessly court danger. And danger they find, in the form of Rig Veda. \n\nVeda's after a big prize: Ray's mirror. But she will have to stop him at all costs, because if Veda gets his hands on the powerful object, he will possess secrets that could lead to disaster.",

One day Tadano-san unexpectedly meets his old girlfriend and they exchange promises: in return for her being faithful to him, he is charged with becoming Japan's best racer within three years. The eponymous \"Monkey Turn\" is a boat maneuver Kenji-san thought up while visiting his girlfriend. The Monkey Turn gives Kenji quite the advantage over other boaters, but is it enough for him become the best?\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Her resistance is in vain and Hoshikai, who tried to protect Otsuki, is stabbed and falls into the sea of blood.\n\nWhen the remaining Otsuki is about to be raped, the school principal's son, Oborozuki (16), appears. With his help, Otsuki's chastity is protected, and Hoshikai's life is saved. However, Oborozuki did not intend to help them for free. Instead, he threatened Otsuki on the condition of \"being his woman for a week\", and Obiyue had no choice but to agree to him.\n\nBut there were conditions for this help. That is, Otsuki will become Oborozuki's woman for a week. Otsuki agrees in order to get out of her predicament, and above all to help Hoshikai. After school, with Hoshikai in the hospital, Otsuki is called to meet with Oborozuki. She begs to release her from the agreement but discovers how eager he is to take over her body.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Tong Li's most recent work is being panned by readers and critics, and Wen Zheng Magazine's recent decline in sales means that her serialization is in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Jiang Xiaobai, fondly remembering making music with his friends in high school, steps in as the backup bassist for a local band struggling to make their break. \n\nSecretly, Tong Li is frustrated both by her writer's block and by Jiang Xiaobai venturing out to chase his old dream. Things come to a head when, following the replacement of the head editor for Editorial Office No. 2, her novel is canceled. As she and Jiang Xiaobai grow estranged and as her family increasingly meddles in their already-strained relationship, Tong Li wanders into a welfare center for autistic people, where she meets a young non-verbal man whose piano playing deeply moves her. She begins to volunteer at the welfare center, not realizing that her and Jiang Xiaobai's worlds are much closer than she thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the project's success, the ELFs soon became sentient, compelling humanity to treat them as near-equals. However, when the Ninth Herrscher laid waste to the planet, almost all traces of ELFs vanished into the Sea of Quanta's endless abyss.\n\nYet, there seems to be a bubble universe where the ELFs' fate has taken a brighter turn. Here, they live peacefully among humans and attend a specialized institution, ELF Academy, where they study as if they were human beings themselves. From Selune's Elegy's chuunibyou tendencies to Blood Embrace's \"gangster\" shenanigans, the peaceful environment of the academy is guaranteed to provide relief from the depressing state of the main universe.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She continued to escape, but Yuri Aoshima, a member of a shady organization, tried to contact her. Orine agreed to Yuri's demand, which was going to an experimental space station.

Unwillingly, she started to place the shut-down device, but she believed that it will solve the mystery and help her mother.\n\nAs Orine and Satomi spend time together, they made up for their lost time. Yuri's aim, Satomi's true identity, and a man called \"SENSEI\" who is involved in taking over the station.\n\nWhile the mystery deepens, Orine gets closer to the \"truth\"...\n\n(Source: Official website)",

The film depicts a macabre game played by two rabbits and a blindfolded woman. The rabbits face each other over an old-fashioned illustrated board game. When they land on a square, the woman must eat the food indicated in the illustration. If she has chosen correctly, a die pops out of her mouth and lands on the floor giving the rabbits their next move.\n\n(Source: Midnight Eye)",

        "synopsis": "The plot consists of a chase of a hijacked MBT-99A tank, designed by the United States Air Force (which is odd, but will become the saviour of Eleanor, as she can be ejected before the tank explodes, like a fighter jet). The audience is expected to be enamored with this vehicle. At one scene when it looks like the tank is sure to get away, the background music turns into cocktail-lounge jazz and sparkly lights swirl around the tank. The tank carries six ATGM launchers (which Ken is somehow able to dislodge with minimal trouble, along with a piece of the turret, towards the end of the movie), three to each side of the turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank's treads are dual-mounted (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank).\n\nThe employment of the laser, however, seems counter-productive to a machine-gun's mission, as it can only fire once every few seconds. If it can fire at higher rates, it does not do so, and tries to acquire a lock on its pursuer (Blader, in this case). This suggests a low ammunition capacity, unlike thousand-round-and-up machine-guns routinely mounted on modern tanks. It does not appear to have any effect on the road, either, which does not say much about its power.\n\nAnother tank involved is the MBT-90D, which are dispatched by the Army (or Air Force\u2014the movie never makes it clear if it is a joint effort, although the general who arrives midway into the movie is shown riding in something resembling an ADATS) to take out the tank. Despite having at least a platoon of these, the MBT-99 still evades capture. The M-90Ds are armed with a three-barreled autocannon, the calibre of which may be around fifteen to twenty millimeters. The MBT-90D is equipped with three ATGM missile launchers, on the left side of the turret, and its main cannon is mounted on the front, instead of on a turret.\n\nAfter the MBT-99's hijackers (who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently-committed bank robbery), hired by a shadowy group, backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military (the M-99 is presumably on its way to be tested at a separate base), are forced out by Ken and his team, Eleanor enters to study the tank, and it starts up on its own, having been programmed by the hijackers to head for a pier and drive off its end so as to rendezvous with an enemy submarine. The rest of the movie is made up of the chase through the city, resulting in the destruction of another bank (owned by the same corporation that built the first bank in the movie), and various collateral damage.",

Most of the Earth has been contaminated and is collapsing into ruin, and a great majority of plants and animals are now extinct. The world heads to the \"Big Six,\" the sixth mass extinction event. Humanity built cities in the sky, migrating the endangered species of animals and plants there. Over many years, the animals evolved in these isolated cities. With artificial genetic crossbreeding, they acquire language, bipedality, and build a life and civilization for themselves free from want. No one thinks of the world below any longer. One day, a single plant seed wanders into one of the sky cities, and the children Kui, Hiruma, and Root discover it. Unable to resist the temptation to look into the world outside, they decide to undertake an adventure to the outside world, unknowing that once they set foot on the ground, they will never be able to return.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

When Momone seizes a porn mag from some boys, Hino claims it's his, and asks if it makes her hot. Back in her apartment, Momone looks through the magazine, which does turn her on. Hino makes a grand entrance, and dominates his professor, forcing Momone to be his bitch. The next day, under instructions from Hino, Momone wears no underwear. It's part of Hino's plan to truly make Momone his own. And boy, he's not very nice about it, either! ",

One day, however, she overhears her friends making fun of a picture book she loved and had given to one of them. She is so devastated that she decides she doesn\u2019t need friends anymore, locks herself into the library and hasn\u2019t taken a single step outside ever since. The God of Books sympathizes with her and gives her a Magic Quill with which she can effortlessly draw any picture and write any story she wants.

        "synopsis": "An omnibus-format TV series consisting of anime adaptations of Japanese folk tales, this is one of Japan's longest-running TV series, and Group Tac's second TV series (the first was The Road to Munich, a documentary anime about the 1972 Olympics). The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation's Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful. \n\nThe rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku's Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history. \n\nWhile this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast. \n\n(Source: Pelleas)",

He's known for his dish Malbo Smul, and this time around we get to see how he procures his meat.\n\nIncidentally, Yama-chan's fighting style definitely looks like that of a Glaive, so apparently there is more to him than meets the eye. \n\n(Source: dualshockers.com)",

The only other name among the staff that rings a bell, though, is Yukihide Takekawa, who was responsible for the music in the magnificent and unknown Unico pilot film. \n\nThe story takes some illogical and confusing jumps at the point where Aladdin begins to court the princess, and the extravagant animation that had characterised Toei films of the 60s, when Toei had the best animators around, had become a thing of the past long before this point; but this is still an above-average film, in large part because of the screenplay that stays so faithful to the original. The character designs are slightly more western-looking than one is accustomed to seeing in anime. \n\n(Source: pelleas.net)",

Working alongside him are the aloof Pepu and the gaming-obsessed Chiku, though the value of their membership remains somewhat questionable. With his two henchmen by his side, the crew's inexperienced leader sets his sights on their first target: Earth.\n\nAccording to the manuals, Earth should be a simple enough target, but the situation spirals out of control right from the start. As it turns out, convincing over seven billion humans to simply roll over and accept their new overlord is no easy feat.

The tragic love story of Mu Hyeok (So Ji Sub of What Happened in Bali) and Eun Chae (Yim Soo Jung of Lump Sugar and I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK) made stars out of its leads and attracted an enormous fanbase throughout Asia. Two years later, G&G Entertainment released a 35-minute animated version of the drama, Between of One Year, consisting of highlights from the drama and new scenes dealing with the final moments of Eun Chae and Mu Hyeok's relationship. The script was supervised by the writer of the original live-action drama, Lee Kyung Hee.",
