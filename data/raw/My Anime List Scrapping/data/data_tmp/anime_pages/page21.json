The girl was torn apart over which one to choose. In her desperation she chose a third option - taking her own life. Although her intentions were absolutely pure, not even in death did she find the solace she desired. Many decades later, a pilgrim walking by her grave meets a beautiful young woman and her story once again rises from the depths of time.... With a plot based on a classic play of Noh traditional theatre, the film presents the peak of Kawamoto\u2019s mastery thanks to its expert mediation of the absurdity of the human condition.\n\n(Source: Karlovy Vary International Film Festival)",

Together with Doraemon, they use a gadget called time camera to take photos of the town sights from various time periods. To their great surprise, the last photo they take depicts Japanese folk hero Momotaro pulling a cart laden with treasure.\n\nLater, Nobita's mom encounters a foreigner who shows the kids a small picture of a person dressed as samurai. The picture looks almost like a photo, and the person in the picture looks exactly like Momotaro. The foreigner has inherited this picture from his ancestors, and he has come to Japan in order to learn the truth about its origins.\n\nNobita begins to think that Momotaro might have been a real person. In order to solve the mystery, he travels to the past of Japan along with Doraemon, Shizuka, Takeshi and Suneo.\n\n(Source: animania.co.uk)",

But Takamine has a secret\u2014she possesses an ability called \"Eternal Virgin Road,\" allowing her to redo past actions and achieve a different result.\n\nWhile this might seem like a decent skill to have, Takamine must pay a price to activate it: she has to strip off a piece of her lingerie. After getting an imperfect score on a test, Takamine begins to remove her underwear during class and is spotted by her average and weak-willed classmate Koushi Shirota, who is bewildered by the sight. However, the very next instant, things reset and Takamine's test is now perfect.\n\nWhen Shirota decides to confront Takamine about her previous test score, she reveals her ability to him and blackmails him into becoming her \"closet,\" making him carry around extra lingerie and put them on her. Her goal is to be able to use Eternal Virgin Road as much as possible in order to stay at the top of the school hierarchy. Left with little choice in the matter, Shirota accepts, starting an oddly intimate type of relationship with the most popular girl at school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But Nanako isn't the only female member of the Takashiro's willing to pay back the family's debt - her mother is also getting in on the action in a jaw dropping display of eroticism that has the Takashiro women surrendering their bodies to a gang of carpet munching marauders. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

As \"Extars,\" the Etiquette Club members fight to eliminate evil from the world, which means the bizarre schemes of Sayaka, the nasty, super-rich president of the rival Debutante Club, and her flunky, Todo. \n\nThe series was created to promote a line of robot toys from Tomy, and viewers who are willing to accept high school girls' quarrels escalating into battles involving satellite weaponry may enjoy these silly adventures.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The story as such concerned the arrival of the real Chojin as he/she (a hermaphrodite) makes moves to wipe out all life on Earth.\n\nInterestingly, the setup for the show was far more heavily connected with the first two, more popular, chapters in the Urotsukidoji saga, with appearances by Nagumo and Akemi (unseen since the early episodes of Part III), and redesigned character models that more closely resembled the earlier episodes. Some of the less popular characters introduced in chapters III and IV, particularly Buju, were nowhere to be seen. Nevertheless, such strategies did little to get this final saga off the ground and the story was shelved.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.\n\nThroughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

At least, the offer sounded generous at first... \n\nNow completely under Takaaki's control, Momoko has no choice but to satisfy his every twisted sexual fantasy. Yet Momoko isn't the only one he's drafting into this new maid service. Using blackmail and bribery, Takaaki's staff continues to grow with gorgeous young maids who are willing to serve him on their hands and knees. But even with all of this beauty surrounding him, for some inexplicable reason, Momoko still remains the target for his ever growing sadistic experiments. Could his unhealthy fixation lead to disaster? \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

To be certified as a wereman so she can become a public servant and let her father retire, she enrolls in Monster Academy. There, she meets Juzu, the son of the monster king who founded the school. Although he is feared by everyone due to his status, when her secret is exposed to the monster prince, she finds out that Juzu is in fact stupid, but is kind and just wanted a friend. With all the eyes of the students on Shushu and Juzu, the inconspicuous life Shushu so direly desired goes down the drain.\n\nNote: The third episode will begin streaming on December 4, 2014 to celebrate the release of the manga's first compiled book volume, which will ship in Japan the same day.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Jin, Akira and Lena are three child hood friends who like mysterious things. One day in the library, along with the mysterious transfer student Ami, they find the \"Akuma Compendium\". They chanted an incantation in the book and, to their surprise, devils appeared. Ami then told Jin and Akira that they are the Devil Children that will decide the fate of the world. She hands them their Devil Risers. The group then pass through the \"Door of Time\" to the land of Valhalla where they fight an evil ruler known as Imperius who plans on conquering all of the world. The Nakama of Jin is Rand, a Sol Lion, and Akira's is Gale, a Hylon.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia.org)",

One day, a puppet he is carving out of wood begins to speak even before he has finished shaping it. The old man names the puppet Pinocchio, and treats him as the son he never had. The puppet is dreadfully naughty and causes trouble for the old man, but his heart is in the right place and he earns Jeppet\u2019s love as though he were a human son. However, tragedy befalls the pair. Pinocchio is deceived by the wicked fox Dino and his sidekick, the cat Witch, while on his way to school. Pinocchio and his friend Gina the duck are sold to the master of a puppet show, with little hope of ever reuniting with kind old Jeppet. The naughty puppet eventually runs away in order to search for his surrogate father, and finds himself in the middle of adventure after adventure, matching wits with the crafty Dino and Witch. His efforts to stay out of mischief never seem to work, and misfortune always seeks out our wooden hero. If Pinocchio can only manage to stay out of trouble, his ultimate wish will be granted and his dream will become a reality. Delighting and entertaining, The Adventures of Pinocchio shows us that a pure heart and good intentions are rewarded, and that true love can indeed create miracles.\n\n(Source: Nipponanimation)\n\nNote that the character is actually called \"Piccolino\" in this adaptation.

When he activates it, he and a girl named Midori are transported to Hell where erotic creatures and monsters of different kinds live. They meet some friends including a sexy elf type woman named Eganko who falls in love with Norikazu, and a perverted monster prince who is soon enslaved by Midori. Using their new friends the pair try to make the dangerous journey back home.\n\nEpisode 2: Having made their way back home the adventure duo find the world they knew is gone, and is now ruled by the demonic computer which first sent them to Hell. They travel back in time to World War II Japan in an attempt to stop the world from being changed. Notably, in doing so they witness the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima, and there is an appearance of the Enola Gay, as well as numerous symbols of Japanese culture at the time.\n\nEpisode 3: This episode has a humorous love-quadrangle plot, where Eganko comes up with a plan to make Norikazu fall in love with her with a love potion, and simultaneously make Midori fall in love with an egotistical young man from her school. Unsurprisingly their plan backfires and everyone gets what they deserve.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Later it lands on the planet, and an alien, mechanic civilization invades King Itaka's peaceful country making nearly everybody their slave. On a fateful night Queen Lilia gives birth to twins, and to avoid misfortune, the nanny Tarama takes one of the babies away, and entrusts it to the gladiator Balga. They still don't know, that the children were born with strong powers, and hold the key to the fight against the enemy that's searching to destroy every human civilisation on the planet...\n\n(Source: Terra e...

There are many variations of this ancient tale, but the main idea is that the gods tie men and women together who are destined as each other's soul mates together with a red thread.\n\nAn invisible red thread connects those who are destined to meet,\nregardless of time, place, or circumstance.\nThe thread may stretch or tangle, but it will never break.\n-ancient Chinese belief\n\n(Source: Nishikata Film Review)",

Unsure if their feelings for each other will remain the same when they next meet, Ann runs off in a panic, only to encounter a portal at the entryway of the castle. Stepping through it, she finds herself 50 years in the future.\n\nIn her confusion, An is approached by a boy named Kibou and his friendly robot, Butler-kun. As luck would have it, Kibou's grandmother instructed him to lend a hand to any troubled girls he encounters at the park, so he offers to be her chaperone. As the three explore the city, An notices that despite how much Okagi has changed, the old charm never evaporated from the nostalgic townscape.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He tells his mother a lie that he placed 92nd, and he tears the answer sheets apart. On his way home from cram school, he accidently breaks the old bicycle that he is supposed to hand down to his little sister, Tamaki. This angers Tamaki. Furthermore, Tamaki accuses him of telling a lie, and he begins to think of her as a nuisance. One night, when he goes to a shrine to look for his missing dog, Chris, he encounters a young man named Yoyogi. Somehow, Yoyogi has the answer sheet marked as \u201c92nd.\" Yoyogi proposes a trade, but threatens to return the answer sheet to its original owner unless he is given something Takane doesn't need. Takane offers him his sister, Tamaki. At that very moment, Tamaki arrives, searching for Takane and Chris. Yoyogi turns Tamaki into a shining object and swallows her. Takane decides that he was wrong and wants to save her. Yoyogi agrees to restore Tamaki to her original form if Takane wins a race against him, with his broken bicycle. Can Takane win the race rescue Tamaki?\n\n(Source: AnimeNFO)",

Their finest assassin is a man named Hayate Kanuma, whose father leads the Shinogara. \n\nHayate, however, knows that the secret society's control over Japan is wrong. Sacrificing his own safety, Hayate kills his father. Now he's on the run, safe almost nowhere from his vengeful former comrades except perhaps for the one hiding place he decides upon: his sister. After possibly being fatally wounded, Hayate is able to transfer his soul into his sister's body, temporarily sharing it with her. His sister, Shiori, can awaken Hayate and call upon his ninja abilities when the Shinogara are close at hand but each time she does so, a little more of her true self is lost. This arrangement can't possibly go on forever, so how will Hayate finally defeat the Shinogara? \n\n(Source: Cammila Albertson)",

Because of this, she had felt self-conscious about herself... especially with men who were constantly leering at her. This only intensified when she was attacked by a rapist with a breast fetish. Although she escaped unharmed, this only made worse her insecurities. It was only because of the intervention of Dr. Chang that she was able to feel good about herself. Out of gratitude, Sara became Dr. Chang's protege in the method of psychic feedback, the method which was used to cure her of her insecurities.\n\nHowever, Dr. Sara's method of therapy is vastly different than what Dr. Chang had used. By swinging her huge breasts in a circle, she is able to induce a hypnotic trance in her patients, after which she is able to learn what is bothering the patient and offer the proper solution. There is a risk of using this: Sara is often vulnerable to the sexual appetites of her patients and she must maintain control of the situation\n\nSara is not alone, though. She is often accompanied by Tamine, a man who cannot seem to get a woman, no matter how he tries. But Tamine is devoted to Sara (mostly because of her huge breasts, which he is able to cop a feel whenever the chance arises), and aids her in helping others in need.",

It was about the mythology of Noah's ark, with the enthusiastic Tezuka Osamu not only writing the scenario but also drawing pictures by himself. During production, however, he unfortunately passed away, so Director Dezaki took over the film and completed it.\n\n(Source: official homepage)",

Child of Destruction tells us more of Riki's past, as we flash back to his childhood to learn the terrible fate of his mother and how he himself was taken away from his twin brother Nachi during a game of hide-and-seek, with Nachi's plaintive cry of \"Are you ready yet?\" haunting him through the years. Riki has a six-pointed star emblazoned on his hand, while Nachi has a swastika on his, the significance of which go unexplained. Riki finds himself in the town of Misaki, dotted with illegal nuclear power plants and run by a religious fanatic military organization called \"God's Judgment.\" He is taken prisoner and made to fight in gladiatorial matches in a sprawling arena. He finds his brother, whose special powers have given him the name of \"Savior,\" but his reunion with his resentful sibling turns sour rather quickly. Part 2 is much gorier than Part 1, with Riki smashing his fists into numerous soldier opponents with far less restraint.\n\n(Source: IMDb)",

His go-to weapon is a 0.01 mm condom which he loads into an arm dispenser, and it opens to reveal a red rubbery armor that Gorou wears in battle. It also gives the hero the ability to summon sperm and created an attack out of the sticky substance.\n\nThere are other characters in the anime like Miku and Hayato who duel using their own condoms. The anime is filled with absurd dialogue and fights, but these heroes always make sure to teach a sex education lesson along the way. \n\n(Source: Comicbook.com)",

Santa Company's elves\u2014known as \"tonttus\"\u2014aid several Santas every year by wrapping presents, raising reindeer, and helping with deliveries. Mint Rondo is one of the many new tonttus arriving at Santa Company's tropical island office. Following in her older brother's footsteps, Mint begins training alongside her friend, Thomas Dou, and rival, Noah, to eventually become a Santa herself. Unfortunately, her clumsiness causes her to fall far behind her peers and into her brother's shadow.\n\nOne day, while sitting on the beach, Mint, Thomas, and Noah discover the biggest threat that Santa Company has faced yet: ocean pollution! With the accumulation of litter going unnoticed, the growing hazard will soon endanger the surrounding ocean wildlife and the members of the Santa Company. As trouble looms over the horizon, Mint might just be able to clean up her act and save everyone on the island in time for Christmas Eve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, the nurse-in-charge, Michiko, secretly switches the two babies due to a personal grudge, resulting in a change of fates of the girls from then on. Many years later, the lives of the two girls continue to be intertwined with each other, with the rich Miki ill-treating the poor Nozomi, yet both of them hold similar dreams to become a singer.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Reaching their destination, her crew member is promptly attacked and she is raped as a warning to stop their work and return immediately to their home country.

Ryoutaro isn't exactly sure what Nozomi's dream is, but he definitely does not want to become a boxer. Unfortunately for Ryoutaro, he finds himself being dragged to the high school boxing club because Nozomi has written a resume for him claiming that he is a boxing genius! It actually seems that Ryoutaro has a special gift for boxing that he has never known about before. Ryoutaro soon finds himself in the winners' circle. But for how long can he last, and can he really live up to Nozomi's expectations?\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

When threatened with an invasion from an unknown enemy, this land quickly falls into chaos. Britain's only hope is the guardian known as Arthur, the one who is chosen by the sacred sword Excalibur.\n\nHowever, this title wasn't exclusive to just one hero. With the sacred sword deeming challengers worthy, this number quickly grew into the millions. As Arthurs, they fulfill their duty as a guardian, in this never-ending struggle against death. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who shoulder a different mission from these Arthurs. \"Destroy Excalibur\". These warriors are referred to as AGENT Arthurs. \n\nTo destroy one million Excaliburs, they wield Excalibur. They are Arthurs, yet not Arthurs. This is a tale of rebellion for those struggling to prevent the end of the world. \n",

Hamtaro can\u2019t forget about her, even when he\u2019s awake. One winter day, Laura talks to Hamtaro. She tells him that everyone in the family is going home to her father\u2019s hometown. When Hamtaro tells his friends about it, Maxwell pulls out a Ham-Ham source book. It\u2019s a book on old hamster history. \n\nAccording to the book, there is a \u201chomeland\u201d for hamsters called \u201cHamja Kingdom\u201d. When the Ham-Hams build a sand castle and recite a spell exactly the way it is written in the book, they are whooshed to the Kingdom. When at last the hamsters reach the bustling Hamja Kingdom of hamsters, the popular King Hamja, the Mini-Hams that they\u2019ve met before in Ham-Ham Land, and many jar spirits called the Mo-Hams appear. A parade begins merrily with singing and dancing! But, the bad magic cat \u201cSabakunya\u201d appears suddenly, riding the giant sheep monster \u201cMee Mee\u201d, and starts to trample the town. What a disaster! \n\nThe Ham-Hams flee underground. The Ham-Hams are told of the state of the Kingdom and find that Sabakunya has snatched the King\u2019s daughter, Princess Shera, and is pressing her into marriage on the Kingdom\u2019s Founding Day. Sabakunya is trying to take over the country. Something clicks in Hamtaro\u2019s mind. Princess Shera is without a doubt the princess who appeared in his dreams! Hamtaro wants very much to run to the castle where Sabakunya is, and so he and the Ham-Hams enter the castle. In the castle, they encounter danger after danger, and Hamtaro, pursued by Sabakunya\u2019s henchmen, is separated from others. ",
