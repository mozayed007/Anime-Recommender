In July, Japan will implement jury trials for the first time in six decades, so most Japanese have never experienced jury duty. The anime uses a high school boy's one-sided infatuation for a classmate as an unusual segue to discuss the jury system. \n\nOmnibus Japan and Tomason produced the animation in collaboration with Group TAC and Studio Cj. Veteran voice actress Minami Takayama (Detective Conan's Conan, Kiki's Delivery Service's Kiki and Ursula) plays the lovestruck boy Sh\u014dta alongside fellow cast members Yuki Tashiro, Daisuke Sakaguchi (Clannad's Youhei Sunohara), and Akeno Watanabe (To Love-Ru's Rito Y\u016bki). \n\n(Source: ANN)",

Miki's bakery isn't getting business, and there is something missing from her desserts. Kazuki is working on a report related to curry for his company, but a coworker tells him he has the wrong approach to the project. After following his coworker around to learn his secret, Kazuki joins his coworker to go to a pachinko parlor and sushi shop. Meanwhile Miki and her friend also travel around the city to a fashion show, the same pachinko parlor, and a restaurant.\n\nAfter talking with his coworker, Kazuki remembers drawing a red sky as a child and not worrying that he was different from other people. Miki's friend tells her that people have to be brave to come up with original ideas. Miki then remembers a time when she watched her father shoveling snow as a child. At that time, her father told her that people have to do bothersome things in order to persevere through the struggle and accomplish something.\n\nMiki experiments with different recipes, and Kazuki does field research. After channeling their creativity and originality, they are both able to succeed in their professions. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

        "synopsis": "Sony unveiled its new \"wena wrist\" smartwatch's \"kawamori Edition\" with Macross anime director and mechanical designer Shoji Kawamori, and naturally, it comes complete with an anime ad. \n\nThe aircraft shown in the video closely evokes the forward-swept-wing YF-19/VF-19 variable fighter designs first seen in Macross Plus and Macross 7, but appears to also draw inspiration from real-life fighter craft, with canards common in European fighters, and an air intake similar to the F-16. The iconic motif of hands in the shape of a fighter also first appeared in Macross Plus.\n\nKawamori designed the case that will ship alongside the Wena Wrist product. The watch itself is a mechanical design, evoking pilot watch-style elements. The dial's design evokes the attitude indicator/artificial horizon seen on fighter instrument panels, with one side being an open-heart design showing the mechanical movement. The 12:00 position is indicated by a white arrow, common to many pilot watches. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

Onibaba is an imposing, violent heifer of a woman who regularly berates and even physically assaults her husband and who enjoys nothing more than making his life miserable; Yukiko and Takobo frequently join in physically and psychologically abusing their father. \n\nThe original manga is said to have been quite shocking to early 1970s Japan, in which the father was often still traditionally regarded as the head of the household.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Choo describes the story as follows:\n\nSince a few years ago, there have been many cases of arson.\nIn the rural town of Kiyotaki, situated in a beautiful mountain valley, the town folks are talking about the legendary arsonist, Akaneko [\u8d64\u732b].\n\nThe police have completely given up on Akaneko, who has slipped through their fingers every time.\n\nThe town's only hope is its one and only firefighting team\u2014the Mizuneko [\u6c34\u732b] Fire Brigade. But because of their destructive fire fighting ways, they too are feared by the town folk. Almost every night, Akaneko and the Mizuneko Fire Brigade fight fiercely, taking down many of the town's buildings in the process. The Mizuneko Fire Brigade have depleted most of the town's financial resources so the town ends up on the verge of bankruptcy. The town was in a critical state when Chinka, a girl with a superhuman ability to smell out fires appears. With her powers, the Mizuneko Fire Brigade close in on the true identity of Akaneko...\n\n(Source: ANN, paraphrased)",

Ji Fa (King Wu of Zhou), assisted by his strategist Jiang Ziya, rallies an army to overthrow the tyrant and restore peace and order. Throughout the story, battles are waged between the kingdoms of Shang and Zhou, with both sides calling upon various supernatural beings \u2013 deities, immortals, demons, spirits, and humans with magical abilities \u2013 to aid them in the war. Yuanshi Tianzun bestows upon Jiang Ziya the Fengshen Bang, a list that empowers him to invest the gods of Heaven. The heroes of Zhou and some of their fallen enemies from Shang are eventually endowed with heavenly ranking and essentially elevated to their roles as gods, hence the title of the novel.\n\n(Source: Wiki)",

This production does not feature any humans, and replacing all familiar elements of the non-existent singers and orchestras are aria and recitative by Hatsune Miku and Vocaloid, with a story told by computer-made music and visuals.\n\nThis production tests taking the traditional tragic structure of an opera asking \"What is death?\" and \"What is an end?\" and puts Hatsune Miku as the mediator to reread it in a modern way.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",

Now Tokyo's mountains are suffering due to unused mature lumber far too dense to support the original ecosystem of the mountains. Kino Tokyo Tree Products offers woods products, gifts, and crafts that embody traditional Japanese culture as well as responsible harvesting of the Tokyo mountain lumber.",

It then delves into explaining that he will be director for the new DC Super Heroes vs. Taka no Tsume Dan film and that there will be a wide variety of benefits between both franchises (discount movie tickets for Brave Frontier gamers, movie characters in the game for Taka no Tsume watchers, etc.). It also features an animated Kaoringo (nickname), who is a real life female public relations staff member for Brave Frontier in the editorial department of Famitsu App. One of the benefits is tickets to a showing where she gives a live in-person introduction to the theater's audience before the movie begins.

Mon's employers don't seem to notice anything odd is going on, and she finds her dream job turning into a chaotically cute trial of wits she has no chance of winning. She's a sweet girl, hardworking and kind, but very unsophisticated and simply not used to walking teddy bears and talking stuffed animals. \n\nShe eventually decides to leave her job and go home, but psychic baby PePe, who has come to love her, finds a way to make sure she stays.",

After the war Okinawa was under the control of the United Stated Military. Without any goods and extreme scarcity of Natural resources the Okinawans were in a desperate day to day survival for the basic needs of life. The Okinawans however, despite their dire situation used song and dance to lighten their spirit and make the best of the situation. But with the loss of almost everything of value on island due to constant shelling bombing and fighting between the Japanese and American all the regular sanshin (an Okinawan musical instrument and precursor of the Japanese shamisen) had become very scarce and hard to find. The American were supplying the Okinawans with powdered milk among other items to help keep starvation low. And from those cans of food they would find a way to bring music back to the people again.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

After winning a business battle with an aristocratic family in the city and getting acquainted with the hermit old beggar, Li Xiaobai, who became famous, was invited to participate in the Young Talents Conference. At the meeting, Li Xiaobai was designed to sit in the challenge position. Fortunately, with the blessing of the system, he defeated his opponent. However, young talents did not achieve it. After discussing with the old beggar, Li Xiaobai understood that young talents are people who serve the country and the people and help the world.\n\nTherefore, Li Xiaobai set up a green channel to encourage everyone to exchange labor for the time limit for bathing. So far, Li Xiaobai has completed the branch line, unlocked the token, and went to the Holy Demon Sect to participate in the entry test.\n\nDuring the test, Li Xiaobai successfully entered the Holy Demon Sect by virtue of the props produced by the system, passing the three levels of body skills, xinxing, and cultivation.

Everyone returned to the sect together and fought hard against the evil cultivators. At this time, Ou Yezi, the head of the Holy Demon Sect, made a move to help everyone repel the evil cultivators.\n\nLi Xiaobai, who thought he could be free and unrestrained for two days, has no choice but to embark on a trip to the secret place under the continuous urging of the system.\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",

Each episode is animated by a different person and aims to showcase what is normal for them and how they grew up to be regular members of society. They were made to promote NHK's awareness campaign for the documentary series. The animated shorts were later streamed on NHK's official website and again later on NHK's official YouTube channel.",

Although this collection contains mainly academic studies, it also includes records of insect observation that lead to literary conclusions with mysterious or mythical imagery. The five essays are done in different animation techniques, and each episode is followed by a scene with the boy Tezuka Osamu and a swallow-tailed butterfly called \"Oomurasaki.\" The film depicts the boy Tezuka Osamu desperately chasing Oomurasaki with his butterfly net, together with what he saw in his dreams. This work was screened at the show \"Tezuka Osamu: Images of the Past and Future\". \n\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)",

The commercial's song was so popular people were requesting the commercial to air instead of regular songs. NHK eventually purchased the rights to feature and have a music video created for a cleaned up version of the song (a significant portion of the lyrics were changed). This was a rare instance as it is one of the few Minna no Uta songs that came from private broadcasters as almost all are created from public broadcasters such as NHK themselves.\n\nThe remade version was still a popular hit and was featured on the Minna no Uta program for 4 months straight.",

It depicts the eldest son, who had to be the pillar of a poor family, and a worker who had no choice but to set fire to the labor movement by collaborating with his colleagues, who did not even know how to protest. At the same time, the film depicts the scenery and characters of the more lyrical time in which Chun Taeil lived. \n\nChun Tae-il is a detailed portrait of the people who wanted to live like human beings in impossible times presented as a painful and beautiful animated film. The voice actors include actors Jang Dongyoon as Chun; Yeom Hyeran as Chun\u2032s mother, Lee Sosun; and Jin Seonkyu; Park Chulmin; and Kwon Haehyo.

Sanpei resolves to enter the contest so that he can have the chance to visit Tokyo and meet with his Mother who seems to have been working there for as long as he can remember.\n\nUnfortunately, Sanpei is not a very able swimmer and so decides to sneak off to a nearby lake to practice in secret. Sanpei quickly finds himself dragged under the water by a strong undercurrent and drowns only to find himself regain consciousness within the magical realm of the Kappa.\n\nThus begins Sanpei's journey as he befriends one of the Kappa children, Gartaro, and begins to learn the real whereabouts of his Mother and the reason behind his Fathers disappearance...

Ryuko heads on alone across the war-torn island. Eventually she reaches safety in Japanese-occupied caves, only to witness the Japanese troops committing suicide with hand grenades. Based on a children's book by Akira Aratagawa and Hikuji Norima, itself inspired by real American footage of an Okinawan girl, Tomiko Higa, waving a white flag at the island's surrender.\n\n(Source: Anime Encyclopedia)",

He is like a younger brother for Mai yet he is actually her older brother because Dai-Chan always asks Mai to hold him up with smiling all over. \n\nOne day, an elementary school Mai goes to and a handicapped school Dai-Chan goes to start to communicate each other. And then, Mai's class mates started to make fun of Mai and draw a funny portrait of Dai-Chan on black board in the class. Mai gets shocked and hurt at that mischief. And moreover, their mother gets sickness at the same time. That's why Dai-Chan should enter in an orphanage for handicapped children; however, Mai really wants to take care of him by herself, so she tries to stop it. \n\nThis story is written about a love of family, close bond, and relationship between human and human. We definitely have a common warm heart and a moment we have to use it with honest feeling. This film could remind us some important things we should never forget about our life.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
