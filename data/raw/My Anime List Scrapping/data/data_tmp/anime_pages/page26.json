Shortly after, Hamtarou is revealed to be hiding under Natsumi's blanket, where he introduces himself to the viewer.\n\nHamuchanzu Corner ~ Biscuits in the Vase (\u30cf\u30e0\u3061\u3083\u3093\u305a\u30b3\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc ~ \u3064\u307c\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u30d3\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8): Hamtarou and the Ham-Hams help Bijou retrieve a biscuit she had dropped while running on the roof posts. After multiple attempts to retrieve the cookie fail, Hamtarou suggests that he be lowered down into the vase, like a prize-catching crane machine. With this plan, Hamtarou is able to retrieve Bijou's biscuit. The vase wobbles and he begins to fall, but the dog wakes up and rescues the hamster by catching him with a pillow. With Hamtarou saved, Bijou hugs Hamtarou graciously and the episode ends as Hamtarou watches the dog slip away to go back to sleep.\n\nI Love You, Natsumi-chan (\u30c9\u30e9\u30de ~ \u5927\u597d\u304d\u3001\u306a\u3064\u307f\u3061\u3083\u3093): The episode opens with Hamtarou having a bit of a manly montage; he seems like he has something important to do. Before she leaves for school, Natsumi tells Hamtarou she likes him while petting him. In response, without her understanding, Hamtarou confesses to Natsumi that he loves her romantically, but knows that Natsumi only loves him as a companion. She then has to leave for school and meets her classmate, Shirohara, to walk with him. Hamtarou wishes to become rivals with the schoolboy, who he knows Natsumi has a crush on. He spends the day venting and whining to Wanta about how Shirohara has beaten him for Natsumi's affection, and eventually tires himself out. At the end of the day, however, Natsumi tells Hamtarou that she loves him very much, which makes him very happy.\n\nHamuchanzu Corner ~ Yellow Happiness (\u30cf\u30e0\u3061\u3083\u3093\u305a\u30b3\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc ~ \u9ec4\u8272\u3044\u3057\u3042\u308f\u305b): Hamtarou and the Ham-Hams appear to be on a scheme to get some sunflower seeds.\n\n(Source: Wikia)",

After taking revenge, I realized that there was a huge conspiracy all over the world. Why did the Sword Stream begin to decline six thousand years ago? Why couldn\u2019t the saints and Sword Gods of six thousand years be unable to obtain Immortality? Why did Chao Qingqiu live in the world with suspended animation? What exactly are lanterns in Buddhism? Is the dragon in the Land of Devils a visitor from the outside world? What\u2019s there? All these things unfolded step by step as Li Fuyao continued to grow.\n\n(Source: Animexin)",

With his hard work and natural intuition of the market, his seed money of one thousand mools grows to seventy-two thousand mools in a matter of months, with the end to his streak nowhere in sight.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the Moon being an economic paradise with limited regulations and low taxes, street urchins like Yoshiharu must always remain on the lookout. After an especially close call with the police, he takes refuge in a church owned and ran by Risa, a part-time worker at a Chinese restaurant. In a stroke of fate, also staying at the church is Hagana, a cold girl with mean eyes and genius-level mathematical abilities. Yoshiharu\u2014now assuming the pseudonym Haru\u2014immediately sees Hagana's potential as a quantitative analyst and establishes a partnership with her for a virtual stock trading competition known to be a ticket into the financial community. As their growing success both in and out of the competition leads to more people investing in Haru and his goal, will he be able to keep his cool and stay on top of the ever-volatile market?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The central character, Shinji, is a boy who loves to draw. In elementary school, he encounters Masaru, a strange young boy who also loves drawing, but who draws only masked wrestlers. The two become friends. \n\nAs they progress through their elementary school grades, however, they gradually grow apart. Years later, Shinji still remains true to his dream of becoming a manga artist, and goes on to study art at the university. When his work is selected for a Best Young Artist Award, he decides to move to Tokyo and soon gets his first breakthrough. What awaits him there, though, is something completely different from the manga artist\u2019s life that he had imagined. One day, for the first time in years, the 30-year-old Shinji comes across some work of his old friend Masaru, who has remained true to his drawing style. \n\nThe story is a mockumentary (\"mock documentary\"), and the narration is interspersed with monologues by Shinji's mother. As the central character grows, the animation style evolves from juvenile drawings doodled on random pieces of paper to sketches drawn on specialized manga paper, thus visualizing the flow of time.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival)",

Wondermaker acts as our guide to each episode's meaning, and transforms himself into each of its heroes. First, he is Perseus cutting off the head of Medusa; then, Actaeon being turned into a deer for spying on the goddess Diana as she bathes; the god Mercury in a tale of envy; Orpheus descending into Hades for his love, Eurydice; and finally, Phaeton wreaking havoc with the sun-god's chariot.",

Here, Tezuka Osamu was in charge of only the original story and a synopsis for animation. \n\nBased on the original Manga, \"Easter Island: Sea voyage,\" Sharaku and Wato investigate a mysterious old ship, only to find themselves getting involved in a sea voyage around strange islands. More emphasis was placed on entertainment factors than on theme, and this change in the concept line resulted in the withdrawal of Tezuka Productions Co., Ltd. from this series.\n\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)",

FUKAZAWA and FUKADA thus succeed in reproducing the ambiance of this mansion so dear to BALZAC, as the artistic pictures call to the imagination and the emotions of the viewer that only be so aroused by a Ga-nime.\n\n(Source: Toei)",

Named Theon, he had high hopes that there would be magic in another world, but there was no magic in that world.\n\nTheon became depressed and lethargic, but an event led him to discover the existence of magic.\n\n\"That's right. If there is no magic, then I will make it myself.\"\n\nWith this in mind, Theon began researching magic from that day onwards. Eventually, through the spread of a disease that can only be cured by magic, and a chance encounter with an enemy that can only be defeated by magic, Theon becomes a hero who saves the world. This is the story of a simple magic fool who, while tossed about by fate, overcomes it with the power of magic and an indomitable fighting spirit, ultimately propagating magic to the people.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",

That evening, the man passes by a bar and is enticed inside where he drinks himself to sleep. When he comes to, he realizes that he is at the bottom of the sea. The man meets a samurai who is suspicious of him at first, but when he realizes that the man is Japanese, they cooperate to hunt for treasure. Almost immediately, they come upon the sunken ship of Mononai-go. What will become of them?\n\n(Source: Digital Meme website)",

When Sarukichi sees Kanisuke following him, he throws persimmon at Kanisuke and kills him. In order to avenge his father's death, the child crab Kanitaro consults with his three uncles, Kurisaku (chestnut), Hachinosuke (bee), and Usubei (mortar). The three promise him to help him. The three uncles enter Sarukichi's house while he is away, where Usubei climbs up on the roof, Hachinosuke stays outside the house, and Kurisaku hides himself behind a folding screen. When Sarukichi returns home, he is surprised by the bursting of chestnuts Kurisaku threw in the fireplace and they have a sword fight. Hachinosuke joins the fight with his spear. When Sarukichi runs out of the house, Usubei falls on his head, and Kanitaro cuts off his nose. Hanging Sarukichi from the spear, the three uncles and Kanitaro return triumphantly.\n\n(Source: animation.filmarchives.jp)",

There were just the beginning signs of reformation in the long regime of Shogun Tokugawa.\n\nIn the remote countryside, on the island of Shikoko, a young boy named Ryoma is growing up in a lower-class Samurai family. A decade later, he is to become on of the leading figures to topple the Shogun's reign and open Japan to the western world.\n\nOur story begins with Ryoma, a dreaming kid of seven years. Ryoma is an honest and tenderd-hearted boy who hates any sort of violence and brutality. He is so sensitive, and a bit naive, that he often cries from pity when he sees even the simples act of violence such as another kid trampling a tiny insect. The kids and even his family call him a \"cry baby\". However, he is not a coward -- not a \"chicken\" at all. His distress comes from a desire to prevent unreasonable acts and the wrong doings in life.\n\nHis older sister is the only person who understands his depth. She recognizes that her brother is gifted with a special talent and she does her best to protect him and cheer him up.\n\n(Source: Enoki Films USA)",

After a gestation period of 3.5 years, Lady Yin, the wife of General Li Jing, gives birth to a flesh ball, which becomes a lotus flower, from which Nezha is born. Nezha is born able to walk and talk, and is taken on as a student of the immortal Taiyi Zhenren.\n\nThe Dragon Kings of the Four Seas, tired of being peaceful, have become cruel and destructive, plaguing China with destructive storms and a drought. The people beg for rain, but the East Sea Dragon King Ao Guang ignores them, telling the yaksha Ye Sha to go and find children for him to eat. Ye Sha captures one of Nezha's friends as he is bathing by the ocean, and Nezha confronts him, injuring him badly. Ao Guang sends his third son, Ao Bing, next. Ao Bing is killed by Nezha, infuriating Ao Guang.\n\nA variety of confrontations ensue between Nezha and Ao Guang. Ao Guang and the other Dragon Kings wreak havoc on the people, causing storms, floods and all manners of natural disasters. Seeing this, Nezha takes his father's sword, tells his parents that he is returning their flesh and bones to them, and calls out for his master before committing suicide by slitting his throat.\n\nHe is reborn with the help of his master, again from a lotus blossom, and is given new weapons and abilities. After breaking into Ao Guang's underwater palace, he confronts Ao Guang and the other Dragon Kings again, and is finally triumphant. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

There was chaos everywhere and the book which was supposed to be enshrined in the Imperial Palace was somehow missing and reappeared in the outlaw societies, luring lots of forces to fight for it.\n\nWhen Han people regained the ruler-ship in Ming dynasty, though the deity's book was found back and enshrined in the Imperial Palace again, those outlaw forces already knew that the book was more than just a legend! It did exist! So they plotted to steal it out. There are there most famous robbers in the outlaw societies: Hell-fire monk, Hua Daochang the thousand-face fox and Duan Yun in white.\n\nOne day, on the ghost festival, they sneaked into the Imperial Palace, trying to steal the most precious treasure, competing for the title of \"the most famous robber.\" At last, the hell-fire monk stole the deity's book.\n\nThe emperor founded the Imperial Guards to serve as his personal bodyguards and imperial secret polices and spies, among whom, there was a young and inexperienced guard\u2014Yuan Xiaotang\uff0cthe hero of this animation. The emperor demanded the Imperial Guards catch the three robbers and find back the book. That's how the story begun!\n\n(Source: CA Fansub)",

A storm is about to descend on this sleepy town.\n\nWe follow Kakeru Niimi, a man who can be a bit curt at times but who has a strong sense of responsibility and a kind heart. Kakeru's ordinary life is thrown into chaos after the local shrine's sacred relic shatters. In the wake of this event, several young men and women awaken to superhuman abilities.\n\nWhat was once a run-of-the-mill life in a run-of-the-mill town soon turns into a quest to track down a super-powered serial killer before they can strike again.\n\n(Source: Sekai Project)",

The two rabbits go to wake Tanuko, the sleepy raccoon dog, and invite him to go skiing. Tanuko, who does not know how to ski, is apprehensive at first, but decides to take up the challenge after watching the rabbits skillfully ski down the slope. Tanuko nervously goes down the slope. On his first attempt, he falls flat on his back. On his second attempt, he goes too fast, causing his legs and skis to detach from his body. The rabbits decide to show off by doing a ski jump. Tanuko, feeling competitive, sits on an umbrella and speeds down the hill. The umbrella turns into a plane and he soars through the sky. Seeing this, the two rabbits' bodies join and turn into a sleigh. They proceed to chase Tanuko. Tanuko's mouth turns into propellers, and he picks up speed. The rabbits go too fast and end up tripping over. Tanuko, while laughing at this, crashes into a cliff and gets buried in snow.\n\n(Source: Japanese Animated Film Classics)",

She enters the virtual ancient world to collect the DNA of animals that are extinct in reality.\n\nBut then an incident happens. Yui tries to leave the virtual world during a maintenance cycle, but instead of being returned to reality she is transferred to a new virtual present. In this new world, generated by the now uncontrollable system, an intelligent species evolved from rodents, called puglaistig exists. They consider the existence of humankind a serious threat and try to stop human evolution by all means.\n\n(Source: Kaninona.org)",

The police hassle them and yet admire them when they break up the gang.\n\nOh, and they're the star pitcher and catcher for the high school baseball team!\n\n(Source: MU)",

Their goal is the end of the dictatorship and total independence from the Federation's influence.\n\nThe story follows the action of the guerilla freedom fighters known as \"The Fang of the Sun.\" The war is fought across the planet Deloyer as the Federation vigorously pursues the rebels.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

It has musical numbers typical this era of Toei films, some awkward slapstic, plenty of scenes tailored to pull on the heartstrings, and very smooth animation. Overall a pleasant film that's interesting to watch for the technical aspects; but the story leaves much to be desired, being on the melodramatic-maudlin side. The later Dezaki/Sugino version is very different, with 52 episodes for the story to breathe in and far more compelling storytelling.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Tang Yao, the guard of Baicheng, led his people to resist desperately, but they were outnumbered, and all sacrificed. Only the second daughter, Tang Ying, survived.\n\nWhat makes Tang Ying even more indignant is that his father sacrificed his life for the country, but in return he was charged with collaborating with the enemy. In order to take the place of her father, Tang Yingyi went to the capital, but found that things were not as simple as imagined.\n\nIs Yuan Lang, the second prince of the Daqi Kingdom who has been hostage for decades, related to Beiyi?\n\nWhy is the woman pretending to be herself so strangely similar?\n\nWhat happened to the otherworldly person that Yao Niang from the movie department was talking about?\n\nThere are also those strange and familiar memories that appeared nervously... There are too many mysteries waiting for Tang Ying to answer. \n\n(Source: Bilibili, Google translated)",

But on performance day, the princess gets sick, and I have to take her place! I'm dreading the final kissing scene. We're just supposed to pretend, but now... our lips are... touching...! I know it's Izuru... but he looks like a handsome prince, and... he's actually kinda hot......\n\n(Source: Ebook Renta)",

Hatta's scheme may seem crazy, but it could be the very thing that improves the strenuous lives of the Taiwanese people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji's story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can't put your finger on the reason why, it's probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii's artsy 1986 feature Angel's Egg. That, and Kenji's wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki's Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji's story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji's magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art, the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.\n\n(Source: pelleas.net)",

While he is talented at teaching elementary school students, he holds no love for children.

But one day, while teaching a fifth-grade class, one of his students hugs him close and tells him that she loves him. And a 14-year old middle-school student named Seika sees the entire thing. Seika blackmails him into giving her \"personal lessons\" at night.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
