Every morning she becomes peevish because she can't go to the ordinary school with her twin brother Riki. Her family soothes Momoko by singing her favorite song \"The Song of Frogs.\"\n\nOne day, Momoko shouts encouragement to Riki who's playing dodgeball at an open classroom day and Riki's team wins the game. Ryuji, whose team lost the game, is not impressed and demands that Riki stop bringing his 'idiot sister' to school. Riki totally loses control and hits Ryuji with all his might.\n\nThe following year, an experiment in integrated education is implemented and Momoko begins to attend Riki's school. Unfortunately, her physical condition takes a turn for the worse and she's sent to a hospital. Riki and all her classmates want to cheer her up and they set a goal of winning a relay race so that they would be able to tell Momoko the good news. Meanwhile, the fastest sprinter, Ryuichi, insists that he won't be taking part in the race.\n\n(Source: Eleven Arts)",

However, she is saved because the president himself offers her a job (some sort of a secret mission). Milk-chan answers the phone to receive missions from The President by saying something like \"Hello, Bank of Hokkaido. Just kidding!\"\n\nAfter getting her mission, Milk-chan and her sidekicks take off aboard the \"Milk-6\" helicopter to go on her mission. Did I tell you this is a spoof of 1970s spy thrillers or some sort of Bond movies?\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Neither of them have many friends; but unlike the dull and boring boy, Shiiba is beautiful and considered to be in a vastly different league to the other males in school. Therefore, no one has had the courage to ask her out. Nonetheless, it comes as a pleasant surprise to the plain boy when Shiiba invites him to an empty room.\n\nElsewhere in the world, a certain teenager has just returned home from a long day at school. As he approaches his room, however, he hears sounds from a porn video he had once watched. Startled, he charges into his room and finds his younger step-sister, Miku, watching the tapes. It is no surprise to her that teenage boys are interested in these things, but what she does not expect is that she would take an interest in it herself\u2026\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

Unbeknownst to her, Shinichi shares the same sentiment but hesitates to convey his true emotions. The state of their relationship changes dramatically when an earthquake causes their school building to collapse\u2014trapping four students inside. Confined alongside Fubuki and Shinichi are Takaaki Tsumura, Shinichi's promiscuous best friend, and the younger and unfamiliar Mizuha Senju, who also harbors feelings for Shinichi.\n\nDetermined to find a way out, the four divide into two pairs to search for an exit. Fubuki soon confesses her love to Shinichi, which he immediately reciprocates. Although their romance seemed destined to blossom, Fubuki's heart is thrown into disarray after Takaaki accuses Shinichi of sexually assaulting Mizuha. As her suspicion only continues to grow, Fubuki finds herself being manipulated by Takaaki while Shinichi remains on the sidelines.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Along the way, he teams up with a company of bandit mice and Pierre, a gentle orphan who has been cheated out of his inheritance.\n\nWhen Pero learns that Princess Rose is seeking a husband, he becomes determined to make sure that Pierre is the one chosen. However, Princess Rose is forcibly betrothed to the wicked ogre Lucifer! Pero begins to spin a web of lies to enthrall Rose with Pierre, but Pero's boasts are far from the truth. Pierre has to keep up with Pero's bold image of him but is frightened, because while Princess Rose is charming, loving her means going against the Devil's wishes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A Soul-devouring Beast sneaked into the Chilan Continent through a crevice on the Nether Battlefield before it ruthlessly slaughtered the Feng Town and the Gao Town. Qin Lie, a young man from the Ling Town, together with Ling Yushi and Gao Yu whom he had grown up with, was commanded to help the Xuantian Union in the conquest of the Soul-devouring Beast.

Among Parappa\u2019s friends are an anthropomorphized blue cat, lamb, and even a flower.\n\nParappa's adventures range from the ordinary to the bizarre. He crosses paths with mischievous baddies, helps resolve questions of friendship and love, and even goes on trips through time itself. Nothing can change Parappa's positive outlook on life.",

Though Ryouma has studied the final match extensively, there are still many gaps in his understanding\u2014gaps that he would only be able to fill by watching the match in person. \n\nAs luck would have it, a supernatural phenomenon transports the young prodigy\u2014and his unsuspecting classmate, Sakuno Ryuzaki\u2014back in time to that very event.

Below is a summary of the events within the 20 minute movie. \n\nThe story focuses on an elite unit of 5 UBCS members, sent into Raccoon City to try and rescue Dr. Cameron. An Umbrella scientist lost in all the confusion. The UBCS team, consisting of members Rodrigo, Roger, Klaus, Ed and Norman, have a GPS device used to track down Dr. Cameron\u2019s last known location, which is near a large food factory. \n\nUpon entering the factory they are attacked by a large creature, a sort of hybrid between a Tyrant and the more evolved forms of Nemesis. \n\n(Source: rehorror.net) ",

The Human race led four other races: the brave warriors, the intelligent magicians, the agile archers and the sly thieves in a fight against the Zakums. In the end, the World Tree activated self-destruction to protect itself. However, the other races thought it was the Human race that destroyed the World Tree. When the World Tree was destroyed most of the races had nothing left, so a number of them went to Maple Island thinking the ones who stayed would die. They escaped Victoria and lived on Maple Island where living is getting harder and harder. Since then, a never-ending war between the different races began.\n\nTen years later, the main protagonist, Al, is determined to revive the World Tree. Al and his companions begin their journey to seek the seeds of the World Tree. At the same time, the Zakums reappear\u2026\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

It sounds shameless, but I got the urge to fall on her bosom as I used to do when I was a child. \n\nWhen I looked at the miserable figure of my father who had died of falling from a horse, I wondered why my mother and she had been attracted by such a person. The next day, a gorgeous carriage arrived at the house. It was from my grand father. He would take care of us because my house was already mortgaged. I didn't know at that time, but he had another reason to take care of us. He didn't have any man relative. Therefore, he adopted me to make me an heir. In this way, my mother-in-law and I went to the grandfather's house.\n",

Ibutani is a low-ranking samurai who is a gifted swordsman and has a straightforward and strong sense of justice. Tezuka has a more carefree attitude. He has an eye for the ladies, but he is passionate about becoming a doctor. The two opposite characters come of age during the backdrop of the turbulent end of the Tokugawa Period (1600-1868 CE).\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo) ",

Leo's newborn cub, Lune, takes an interest to humans after discovering a music box in the wreckage of an airplane. At the same time, a greedy treasure hunter known as Ham Egg is leading an expedition team of rough-looking men on a trek for the fabled Moonlight Stones, which can supposedly save the world from an energy crisis. Two other humans, (who go by the rather wacky names of Dr. Moustache and Lemonade) try to stop Ham Egg's mad destruction of the jungle. Later, a terrible virus sweeps through the jungle, poisoning many of the animals. Dr. Moustache comes to save them with a cure. The film culminates with a treacherous journey up the legendary Mt. Moon in search of the stones....\n\n(Source: ANN)",

They were happy children who worked and played as they should. All that changed when the Snow Queen's mirror broke. The shards spread all through the world, each containing evil. If a shard went inside your eye, it would turn your heart to ice. A shard went into Kai's eye. After that, he grew cold to those he loved. \n\nOne night, the Snow Queen came in her carriage and took Kai back to her ice castle at the farthest north point of the world. Everyone in Kai and Gerda's village didn't know where he went and believed he died from drowning in the frozen-over lake. Gerda doesn't believe this, for she dreamed of seeing Kai enter the carriage. When a drunk man admits that he also saw this, Gerda starts realizing that maybe what she saw wasn't a dream. She packs her things and goes on a journey to save Kai and bring him back home. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Four evil gods used to support this world by acting as pillars, but they ran away including all the other minor gods that lived in this world. Thus, people called Kashikan's appeared. Their job is to capture the gods that fled and return stability to the country. The main character Ichiyou is a Kashikan who unwillingly took up the job to regain his foster father's freedom. His foster father, a tiger, was captured to act as a replacement of the four gods who ran away. Ichiyou's main objective is to recapture the evil gods and take back the peaceful life that he used to live.\n\n(Source: zcigaara)",

        "synopsis": "One of the must-see gems making its premiere at our festival, Midori-Ko is adored Japanese animator Kurosaka Keita's whimsically nightmarish vision of 21st-century Tokyo on the brink of apocalypse. Ten years in the making and entirely, single-handedly rendered in colored pencil, Kurosaka's fantastical labor of love is a marvel to behold. Emerging from the staggering detail and craft flooding every frame is the story of a young woman who sets out to engineer a dream-food that can put an end to the world's famine. Synthesizing Frederic Back's subtle, haptic textures with Bill Plympton's frenetic mutations and David Lynch's haunting wormholes, Kurosaka\u2019s work still retains its own singular, luminous potency.\n\n(Source: Los Angeles Animation Festival summary)",

Owing to his nasty physique and meager intellect, he has little prospect in getting the attention of, let alone developing a romantic relationship with, the woman of his dreams.\n\nWhen Takeshi is on the verge of giving up, God bestows upon him hypnosis powers, which Takeshi uses to seduce the attractive girls at his school and build his own harem.\n\nHe now embarks on a perverted quest, entrapping both classmates and teachers alike under his command. The academy soon transforms into his exclusive sexual playground as more and more girls begin submitting to his influence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "The \"Bobby\" referred to in the title is actually 17-year-old Akihiko Nomura, an underachieving high school kid with a deep love for motorcycles. His grades are failing, and his father \u2013 traditional and strict (but who must have also at some point gave in and allowed him to have a motorcycle) \u2013 is trying everything he can think of to get the kid to apply for college. His mother is so silent, she might as well not even exist. Really, his support system lies entirely in his twinkle-toed little sister, who's nosy but cheers him on in her own way.\n\nBobby really does little else but work on his bike. He cleans his bike. He tunes up his bike. He rides his bike. One would call him a motorcycle otaku. His most recent achievement seems to have been getting photos of himself on a road trip printed in a motorcyclist hobby magazine. This leads to an unexpected result: a girl his age, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A long, rambling letter, but dreamily romantic just the same. Bobby admits to his sister that he's never gotten a letter from a girl before. He writes back, \"I got your letter. I'm happy 'cause it was from a girl.\"\n\nBobby is not a well-rounded kid. He barely speaks \u2013 even to his own family \u2013 and the \"letters\" he writes back to the mystery girl usually consist of a single sentence or so. His obsession is all-consuming, to the point where he happily quits school to work at a biker bar. Of course, his father, at a loss, kicks him out of the house. Staying with a friend, he's delighted when his female pen pal says she'll call him. On that day, his boss at the bar decides to take him to a motocross track. But that's a day that wouldn't end in a way that anybody would expect.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)",

This sounds really depressing, but it's actually a very funny comedy. \n\nThe story is set in Osaka, which has a totally different culture from Tokyo. After the success of the movie, a TV series was made, and Takahata worked as the chief director.\n\n(Source: nausicaa.net)",

Many years have passed and now, Naoto Rindo will be the unfortunate one. His former fianc\u00e9, Suzune Hizuki has passed away due to a tragic accident and now he must impregnate one of the other four girls from the Hizuki family, however, time is running short.\n\nBut wait, did Suzune really die? Mysteries abound around what exactly did happen and will happen since Suzune is still alive.",

However, Dracula, the King of Vampires, swoops in and steals her, with the intent of depriving the woman of both her blood and her life. And yet, despite his earlier motives for abducting the bride, Dracula is astonished by her beauty and decides to keep the woman as his wife. \n\nHe and Domini, his spouse, lead a fruitful life together, bearing a healthy son by the name of Janus, with Dracula's crime against Satan fading from memory. On the other hand, Satan hasn't forgiven him for stealing his rightful bride and is plotting to ruin his happiness when the time is right. Another group, the Vampire Hunters, similarly wish to destroy Dracula as vengeance for the souls he has taken to feed himself. \n\nNow carrying the burden of a family, Dracula must protect himself from Satan's plots as well as from the vengeful Vampire Hunters in a desperate fight for survival and forbidden love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A long time ago, a powerful god named Gestalt was banished to the earth and he had found refuge in the island known as G. To utter the name for which it stands is forbidden, for people were so afraid of the wrath of the god that they considered his name a curse. Father Oliver is a priest who has left his order and traveled to the island of G in order to discover the truth behind it. He ends up making the acquaintance of a young girl named Ohri, who turns out to be quite adept in magic.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the order has hired a dark elf named, Suzu, to track down Oliver and bring him back. Suzu finds him easily enough. However, she hadn't anticipated the powerful sorceress in his company, Ohri. The girl disposes of Suzu for the moment, and she and the Father continue on. As if things weren't rough enough, the island of G has it's share of monsters and magic-users to get in the way of their travels.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The story is said to take a darker tone.\n\nThe game's production was announced in 2015 and the official launch is expected some time later this year.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)",

However, in a test driving made prior to its completion, he was involved in an accident and judged as dead. Meanwhile his father Daisuke who was watching the test driving all the way recovered the wrecked car as his son`s memento. A few years later the damaged car rebuilt by him revives as the new Mach which comes to participate in Grand Prix. This time, however, for the purpose to protect the driver from a possible accident, the new car is equipped with a safety system called \"Safety Seven\" with seven guarding devices. Also, it is loaded with the engine \"X\" that miraculously survived the tragic accident. Now its driver is Go, younger brother of Kenichi, who is determined to succeed to his brother`s will. In fact, he successfully participates in Grand Prix and keeps growing up to be a top racer of the world.\n\n(Source: official site)",

Screams erupt from the people as the pillar of light takes flight, absorbing everything in its destructive path. A tower clock dings the hour of 4 o'clock as the pillar disintegrates, leaving behind a trail of cybernetic residue and utter emptiness.\n\n'The Program of Light and Dark'\n\n(Source: Official Site)",

Miracle, Chris, Quan, Riz, and Noelle\u2014along with several other top virtual artists\u2014will compete in the main event of the ceremony: a Unit Battle, where participants enter as a team to compete for a spot in the main event's concert.\n\nAs the competition heats up, PathTLIVE reviews their competitors who have made it to the main event and evaluates if they have what it takes to win. But when the girls begin to lose confidence, they look inward to see how they can improve themselves to prepare for the Unit Battle. Through collaborations with other top performers, each girl explores new facets of what it means to be a virtual artist.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Still, two more episodes about the same story were produced a bit later, this time under the main title \"Rockman\" (unlike Episode 2, where he's called Mega Man, even in the japanese dub).\n\nIt's unknown if these 3 Episodes ever saw an official release, until 2002, when Capcom of Japan decided to finally (re)release them on DVD for Rockman's 15th Anniversary (all featuring a Japanese and English dub, but no subs).\n\nIt's unknown if there are any more secret animated works of the original Rockman game-series.\"\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

He is engaged to Sharon, a beautiful swordswoman who generally like Astral but wishes he was stronger.\n\n(Source: Urhentai)",

Its inhabitants partake the journey to migrate back to Earth.\n\nAttempting to regenerate the Earth to make it hospitable, the migrants come up with a \"Zi-Forming\" scheme.\n\nHowever, the plan fails and Earth is left in its state of turmoil. Overrun by Zoids and blanked by unstable weather phenomena, the migrants are faced with a difficult life. The Empire and Republic settlements attempt to uncover Zoids buried within the Earth to bolster their respective armies.\n\nThe story picks up following second-generation Earth citizens: Leo Conrad and Buzz Cunningham, who have a chance encounter with a girl Sally Land as she flees the clutches of the Empire.\n\n(Source: Zoids Wiki)",

Superman made it clear to all Permans that their identity must be kept a secret or their brain will be destroyed should it ever be revealed and they are given a special doppelganger robot that can replace them while they are away to achieve this feat, although it is not entirely foolproof nor is it free from potential problems. These equipments then allowed them to be young Permans who try to maintain peace and help the people who are in need.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Sanada, Aihara, and Shima are released from the hospital, and go to pay their respects to the fallen crew members at Okita's memorial. They meet Tokugawa's son Tasuke, who says that he will be joining the crew once he graduates from cadet school. The next day at his graduation, he ends up capsizing a boat full of new cadets because they are all too busy staring at the Yamato to watch where they are going.\n\nAfter some problems during launch due to the new engine crew hitting the wrong switches and stalling the ship, the Yamato departs on what should be a simple training mission.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
