Mario then discovers a small brooch that Peach left on the floor.\n\nThe next day, the brooch that Peach dropped becomes a matter of concern for Mario. Luigi immediately notices the brooch and regards it as the \"Visionary Jewel from the Country of Treasure\". Soon, Kibidango, a small dog-like being, wanders into the store and notices that Mario has Peach's brooch. He takes it away from Mario, enraging him, thus beginning his (and Luigi's) chase with Kibidango into the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Largely uninhabited and covered by dense forests, these monster-infested regions are abundant in a mysterious ore called the Nova Stone. The coveted stone overflows with energy, and those successful in their hunt are bound to acquire obscene amounts of wealth. Yet the frontier remains a dreadful place. The only ones capable of staving off imminent devastation to human settlements are the hunters. Since their weapons, powered by Nova Stone, are capable of vanquishing the beasts, these brave souls are tasked with the protection of otherwise defenseless towns.\n\nOrphaned at a young age, Erika Amber was taken in by a huntress and raised as her successor. However, she is no ordinary human; her elven lineage has remained a mystery for Erika her entire life. Hoping to discover more about her ancestors, she ventures deep into the unexplored forests, leaving civilization behind. But before departing, she decides to visit Azul\u2014the son of a recently deceased hunter\u2014one last time. In a heart-to-heart talk, the boy reveals he admires the huntress and is deeply in love with her. As luck would have it, the feeling is mutual, and the memory of the passionate lovemaking that follows is likely to keep Erika warm during the long, chilly nights throughout her journey.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

Kingdoms and villages from around the world send over a thousand sacrificial maidens to the island in an attempt to satisfy the demon lord's legendary lust and protect their lands from the unspeakable destruction he will bring. However, the legends are false, Exoda does not possess such lust, and is not interested in destroying the world. He's quite happy to live in peace and go fishing on the weekends. More than one thousand girls on his island are now unable to return to their homelands, as by coming to Shina Dark, they are seen to be tainted brides of Exoda by others. As a result, Exoda decided to create a nation to give the abandoned girls a new life in a new country, Shina Dark. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

In order to protect the colonies and maintain law and order in the solar system, the Earth Federation Government (EFG) was created. Soon, many settlers started to resent the EFG's and its sphere of influence, straining the relationship between the central government and the colonies.\n\nWhile a strained peace was being forged between Earth and the colonies, a race of non-human creatures known as Deathcula invaded the System. Without provocation, they attacked the colonies and killed many of the colonists. The EFG quickly realized that the Deathcula were technologically superior and their forces were hopelessly matched. In order to have a chance at survival, Dr. Charles Louvre developed a transformable starship known as the Bismarck.\n\nKnowing that an advanced team of specialists were required to operate the Bismarck, four individuals came together and were charged with keeping the outer colonies safe from further Deathcula attacks.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

When Hiroshi returned home after a beauty treatment, he was surprised to see himself in the form of a robot. Shinnosuke gets overjoyed, whereas Misae gets worried on seeing him as a naked robot. The robot version of Hiroshi turns out to be convenient. The robot Hiroshi could be controlled by a remote control and pretty much do anything including cooking and cleaning. Meanwhile, Hiroshi realizes that his turning into a robot has to do something with that Este salon. However, this new change was a dark conspiracy hatched by \u201cChichi Yure Doumei (The Association of Fathers)\u201d to create a strong father figure for all the fathers in Japan. Soon, many dads in the whole nation go out of control, and the Nohara family (Shinnosuke's family) and Kasukabe start falling apart. Before the near-collapse of Kasukabe, Shinnosuke and Hiroshi i.e. Robot dad stand up to save the day. Featuring the most intense battle of middle-aged men, the movie brings a touching story that makes all fathers and families in Japan cry.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She avoids eating vegetables at all costs, and wakes up early so she and her friend Momo can walk out of their way to avoid the bridge.\n\nOne day, Momo gets a dog that cannot be walked on the busy road she and Mari usually take, and Momo walks across the bridge, leaving Mari to walk to school alone. That same day, Mari's teacher sets a goal for the class to stop leaving food on their plates at lunchtime and Mari has to eat all three of her least favorite foods: carrots, peppers, and milk. After passing out from the shock of eating the vegetables, she awakens in the nurse's office to three food spirits calling themselves Ninninman, Piiman, and Milk. With the help of these bizarre beings, can Mari overcome her fears?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

But despite the constant reminders that he's \"not as good as his brother\", Takashi was never jealous because Satoshi took him in after their parents died. But that was before Satoshi stole Miwa, the love of Takashi\u2019s life, and married her.\n\nMiwa, both incredibly beautiful and kind, she captured Takashi's heart long before she ever agreed to marry his brother. And now that she\u2019s Satoshi's wife, Takashi sees her every day. Sees her with him. Hears her having sex with him through the bedroom wall. And each day Takashi's jealousy towards his brother grows a little more.\n\nBut it seems the tables may turn when Takashi's voluptuous college professor discovers that Takashi scores in one way over his brother: his sexual prowess. Now with the right clothing, the right hairstyle, and lots and lots of hands-on sexual tutoring, she's going to turn Takashi into a ladies' man that even his brother will envy!\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

She's got a Mad Scientist named Breckenridge living upstairs who is chronically late with the rent, and she's pining for Jim, a handsome watchmaker's apprentice whom she mistakenly believes is pursuing the local flower girl.\n\nBut this isn't our world. It is a world that has the Spirit of Wonder, where every so often, just occasionally mind you, amazing things happen. The Mad Scientist actually has come up with an incredible invention, and Jim has an unbelievable plan to use it to give Miss China the most beautiful ring in all the World.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

But then one day as his father is testing a piece of equipment he has been working on, something causes it to blow up, taking the house with it! Now orphaned, Hajime is taken in by his uncle, who is an astronomer. There at his uncle's observatory, he meets a girl he's seen before and developed somewhat of a crush on. He finds out her name is Yukino Yayoi, and her parents run a ramen shop in town. But even better than that, she's his uncle's assistant! What luck! \n\nBut Yayoi isn't exactly what she seems. There is a reason she helps out Amamori-san at the observatory. She is the Millennial Queen (Sen-Nen Joou), specially chosen by her home planet, LaMetal, to go to Earth and help prepare for the possible annihilation of the planet. What will cause this disaster? LaMetal has an extremely elliptical orbit, which sends it very, very near Earth every 1000 years. When it gets close enough, the earth reacts, causing all sorts of natural disasters. Although she was chosen with the idea of protecting LaMetal in mind, her personal plan is to evacuate as many humans as she can to LaMetal, so if their planet is destroyed, they will survive. \n\nHowever, there is one person who strives to stop her plan, the head of the Millennial Theives. Why does he want to stop Yayoi? And how does he know about the Millennial Queen, anyway? \n\n(Source: AniDB) ",

In the final round S.A. shows their \"soccer cyborg\" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable.

The reasons these girls are thrown into this unusual career are many, ranging from debt to punishment for crime. Treated as nothing more than government-sponsored  commodities, they are stripped of their clothing and identified only by their assigned number.\n\nNakagawa rarely pays much attention to anyone at school, but that changes when he enters a relationship with the girl known as 'Number 3.' Since personal interactions between the students and the girls are forbidden, the two decide to use the school rooftop as their private meeting place. Spending their days together in secret, Nakagawa begins to learn more about Number 3 as well as the dark truth behind the controversial program.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Lethal injections make steroids seem like vitamins. Instead of team prayer, there's demonic possession. Athletic sponsors are malevolent corporations with a more frightening agenda than increased market share. It's all just part of the game.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Confronted by the Parisian guards over their illegal dueling, D'Artagnan and the Musketeers fend off five of Cardinal Richelieu's soldiers, and the four of them quickly become friends.\n\nThe four new comrades set off to stop the Cardinal from starting war between England and France, and protect the image of Queen Anne d'Autriche, the wife of Louis XIII. But what will be the cost of their efforts?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their leader, Mr. Invader, offered to spare the planet if a randomly selected human could defeat his daughter Lum in a game of tag. As luck would have it, the fate of the planet rested on the shoulders of the housewife's troublesome son. In a turn of events, the challenge ended with young Ataru's victory\u2014and with his royal opponent becoming an inadvertent addition to the Moroboshi household.\n\nAtaru's mother reflects on all the characters her son has been involved with\u2014friends and foes, both human and extraterrestrial\u2014and the stress their antics have caused her. Unsure whether to admire her son's fortitude or consider him pathetic, Mother Morobashi can only muse if her family will ever experience peace and quiet again.\n\nShuugaku Ryokou!: Kunoichi yo Hashire\nKaede is a young ninja, or kunoichi, who doubts her current line of work. Her elderly and irate master, Yatsude, is intent on her remaining a ninja; and to make matters worse, Kaede has further infuriated her master by losing a confidential scroll in the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, Ataru finds his school excursion to the ancient capital of Nara tedious. However, stumbling upon the scroll and gaining Kaede's attention makes his field trip a little more interesting.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

Mana overflowed from their remains, drawing people who sought its power, and civilizations sprang up. People came to revere these mana-producing creatures, which they named 'Primordial Beasts'. They built their lives around them. Thus began the worship of the Primordial Beasts.\n\nTime flowed ever onward, to the present day... War erupts between the Jerle Federation, an alliance of countries who worship the Primordial Beasts, and the Gildllan Empire, which has enjoyed explosive development thanks to advanced technology. The fires of war burn ever brighter.\n\nThe special animated feature will tell an important juncture in the story of Luminaria, congealing and bringing to life the game's theme of \"confronting antagonistic ideas of justice\"!\n\n(Source: Official website)",

Neither of them have many friends; but unlike the dull and boring boy, Shiiba is beautiful and considered to be in a vastly different league to the other males in school. Therefore, no one has had the courage to ask her out. Nonetheless, it comes as a pleasant surprise to the plain boy when Shiiba invites him to an empty room.\n\nElsewhere in the world, a certain teenager has just returned home from a long day at school. As he approaches his room, however, he hears sounds from a porn video he had once watched. Startled, he charges into his room and finds his younger step-sister, Miku, watching the tapes. It is no surprise to her that teenage boys are interested in these things, but what she does not expect is that she would take an interest in it herself\u2026\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

In the end, the World Tree activated self-destruction to protect itself. However, the other races thought it was the Human race that destroyed the World Tree. When the World Tree was destroyed most of the races had nothing left, so a number of them went to Maple Island thinking the ones who stayed would die. They escaped Victoria and lived on Maple Island where living is getting harder and harder. Since then, a never-ending war between the different races began.\n\nTen years later, the main protagonist, Al, is determined to revive the World Tree. Al and his companions begin their journey to seek the seeds of the World Tree. At the same time, the Zakums reappear\u2026\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The few remaining survivors escaped to Earth and split into three families, named Jin, Kamie, and Kamikita respectively. While attempting to start a new life, the collectively known \"Jin Family\" prepared for the inevitable Gaizok invasion on Earth and its giant mechanical beasts known as \"Mecha Boosts\". In order to defend their new home, they have built three vehicles which when combined form the mighty Zambot 3. The Jin Family must not only defend against Gaizok attacks, but also harsh criticisms from the very people they protect, who blame the Jin Family for the invasion in the first place.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

After the Japanese team lost two games against this apparently supreme opponent, their confidence is at its lowest point and even Hyuga, having a hurt leg, is desperate. Thus the management tries everything to convince Wakabayashi (living in Germany) and Tsubasa (living in Brazil) to come to Holland and to help them, but both deny. Only in the second half of the third game Tsubasa appears and joins the team, giving them back their confidence and strength. With Tsubasa Ozora as their captain again, the last game ends 11:1 for Japan.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
