However, he lost his life during the battle with the Sage Emperor and six deity-ranked beasts.\n\nHis soul was then brought back to when he was still 13 years old. Although he's the weakest in his class with the lowest talent, having only a red soul realm and a weak one at that, with the aid of the vast knowledge which he accumulated from his previous life, he decided to train faster than anyone could expect. He also decided to help those who died nobly in his previous life to train faster as well.\n\nHe aims to protect the city from the coming future of being devastated by demon beasts and the previous fate of ending up destroyed. He aims to protect his lover, friends, family and fellow citizens who died in the beast assault or its aftermath. And he aims to destroy the so-called Sacred family who arrogantly abandoned their duty and betrayed the city in his past life.\n\n(Source: Goodreads)",

After one very romantic gesture by a popular upperclassman, she falls head over heels for who she believes to be her one true love. Unfortunately, love can be deceiving, as her feelings are soon proven to be one-sided; the upperclassman directly tells her that she\u2019s annoying and that she needs to stop bothering him. How's that for some tough love?\n\nShortly after this horrific heartbreak, her good friend Yuri suffers from a sprained wrist, making it impossible for her to continue her position as the basketball team's manager. After some coaxing on Yuri's part, Tsubasa decides to take on the role in her place. This may be the perfect opportunity for Tsubasa to move on and forget about her unrequited love.\n\nOn Tsubasa\u2019s first day as a manager, the team\u2019s shooting guard Aki Hidaka saves her from being hit by a ball. Is this another fateful encounter? Or just a random, meaningless event? One thing is for certain: Tsubasa\u2019s days will never be the same again.",

Although she makes a disastrous first impression, Hana soon befriends two of her classmates: the gentle and studious class representative Saaya Yakushiji, and a cool and mysterious girl Homare Kagayaki.\n\nThat night, a magical baby falls from the sky right onto Hana's balcony. She is immediately smitten with her and names her Hug-tan. Alongside Hug-tan is a snarky talking hamster, Hariham Harry, who mutters that Hana \"isn't the one\" before vanishing with the baby.\n\nThe next day, Hana believes the encounter to be a dream, until people all over the city begin collapsing and a giant monster appears, feeding on their energy. As Hana escapes, she spots Hug-tan and Harry under attack. Making a stand to protect them, she and Hug-tan suddenly both glow with energy and a heart-shaped gem forms.\n\nWith the crystal's power, Hana transforms into a hero called \"Cure Yell\" and defeats the monster. Surprised at Hana's power, Harry explains that he and Hug-tan came from a future frozen in time by the Criasu Corporation, the same organization that created the monster. Only the Future Crystals, manifestations of one's hopes and dreams, and the Precure they create have a chance at defeating Criasu and saving the future!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But in this battle between Dr. Hell and the Kabuto family, many legends surrounding the Mycenaean Civilization and Bardos Island, as well as the secrets of Mazinger Z remain shrouded in mystery.\n\nA new series based on the mecha show that started it all, Mazinger Z. Shin Mazinger Shougeki! Z-Hen starts over from the beginning with a new cast, to tell a new story unrelated to the original show.\n\n(Source: shin-mazinger.com)",

During an annual concert event, Hummy, the cat songstress of Major Land, prepares to sing the \"Melody of Happiness,\" capable of spreading happiness to worlds beyond. However, Mephisto, the king of Minor Land, interrupts the event and rewrites the score into the \"Melody of Sorrow\"\u2014a dissonant composition that would instead cause despair when performed. In order to prevent this from happening, Hummy is tasked with finding the Precure, renowned warriors with an unmatched passion for music, and recreating the Melody of Happiness.\n\nHummy arrives in Kanon Town, home of musically-inclined athlete Hibiki Houjou and studious baker Kanade Minamino. Engaging only in endless bickers, Hibiki and Kanade were formerly best friends and have since fallen out of touch. Their activities are stopped short by an unwelcome guest\u2014the songstress of Minor Land, Siren. \n\nWhen Siren turns an important record into a gigantic monster, the girls' hearts resonate with the desire to protect what they hold dear and the two transform into the Suite Precure! As legendary warriors, Hibiki and Kanade will have to put their personal squabbles aside if they wish to protect the happiness of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, the two teams end up fooling around more than playing tennis with a surprise encounter from Higa Middle School's tennis team, who have been left stranded in Osaka by their coach. When asked about the reason for accepting the invitation, Seishun's captain, Kunimitsu Tezuka, hints that there is an ulterior motive behind the meeting of the two schools.\n\nFuun Shounen Atobe (Turbulence: The Young Atobe)\nOn the first day of school at Hyoutei Academy, the freshman class representative, Keigo Atobe, declares himself \"King'' of the school and donates his family's wealth to fund new facilities. Setting his sights on the school's tennis club, he plans to make himself the captain after overthrowing its current hierarchy by defeating all of the team's regulars. Atobe's arrogant personality rubs Ryou Shishido and Gakuto Mukahi the wrong way and the two decide to challenge him, refusing to accept him as the team's new leader. But the two quickly learn that the kid who is all talk also happens to have the skills to back it up.\n\nNaniwa no Ouji-sama: Kouhen (The Prince of Naniwa: Second Act)\nTezuka places the second years, Kaoru Kaidou and Takeshi Momoshiro, in charge of creating a lineup for the Shitenhouji practice matches. Struggling to pick worthy club members, Kaidou and Momoshiro begin to lash out against their fellow teammates. After being told to cool off, the two begin to search for the meaning behind Tezuka asking them to take on such an important responsibility.\n\nRikkai Retsuden: Ouja ni Idomu Hangyakuji (The Trials of Rikkai: A Rebel Who Challenges an Emperor)\nIn his first year at Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School, Akaya Kirihara boldly proclaims that he will join the tennis team that won last year's national tournament and become Japan's #1 tennis player. When he single-handedly defeats the team's third years, he mistakenly believes that the group is weaker than they were reported to be. Kirihara soon learns that the reason Rikkai won last year's national championship was due to the \"Big Three\" and quickly finds himself losing without them breaking a sweat. Angered and humiliated by his loss, he begins to train hard by himself in order to challenge them again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The genie grants Gokudou the standard three wishes, but our anti-hero doesn't think heavily about his wishes. Gokudou does get his wishes, though not exactly in the fashion that he expected. The best thing he gets out of his wishes is Honou no Maken, a magical sword that enables its owner to do fire attacks and it can be summoned from anywhere in the world.\n\nEven with an enchanted sword, Gokudou doesn't get much respect. He gets turned into a woman by Djinn, who is also a shapeshifter. He is followed by Rubette La Late, a potential love interest who is more interested in adventure, karaoke and outperforming Gokudou. He gets whapped on the head a lot, especially by the fortuneteller who reappears throughout the series just to plague Gokudou it seems. Later in the series, he gets another sidekick, a former evil magician named Prince, who is more handsome and a better womanizer than Gokudou.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

He is always up to some kind of mischief, often teasing his sister or making rude comments to others. Consequently, his mother constantly scolds him, and even the neighbours express disturbance from time to time on how rowdy he can be.\n\nOne day, after pulling a terrible prank, Ichiro sprints onto the streets as his mother chases him. He steals a nearby bicycle and takes on a dangerous route, eventually being hit by a truck. Miraculously, he survives the crash, requiring nine stitches to the back of his head and balding for the surgery. However, the near-death experience gains him the ability to see ghosts\u2014the last thing he needs in his life.\n\nSince Ichiro is the only one who can communicate with them, several ghosts of people who have recently died come to him, seeking help to fulfill their last wishes before achieving enlightenment. Each adventure with a ghost leaves the young and curious boy with a different lesson that gradually makes him wiser.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Here, humans, demons, and criminals walk the streets with the mighty witch Annerose being one of the most feared and respected of the city's denizens. As part of her abilities, she was able to form a binding spell with a human male, keeping him as her undead servant. This man, Rikurou Tachibana, was about to end up sold to slavers, but instead, he wound up in the eternal service of Annerose\u2014something her other servent, Mitico didn't take too kindly to. Rikurou doesn't know what's worse, Mitico being able to chop him up into tiny pieces, only to be resurrected, or having to deal with the intense sexual frustration of living with Annerose.\n\nBoth of these problems get set aside, however, when Annerose and her servants take on a case involving a girl named Miki and her missing brother. The events of Koutetsu no Majo Annerose will lead the unlikely heroine into the workings of the Kuurou Group and their leader Lee Mayfeng, a sworn enemy from Annerose's past. Mayfeng's contempt for Annerose is deep enough to plunge into the depths of sexual depravity and she's willing to do anything to humiliate and ruin her. The danger only grows from there as yet another malevolent force is at work, one that goes well beyond threatening Amidahara and aims to bring about ruin to the entire world.",

The orphaned Maia Mizuki, 15, just graduated from middle school and has already applied for employment in the elite paramilitary Ocean Agency, part of the futuristic world government. Only the best, most intelligent, and physically fit students are eligible for admission. Maia, the series' protagonist, is set to become one of the few.\n\nBut her ideal life quickly falls apart. To her disappointment, Maia unexpectedly fails her entrance exams. Making matters worse, she promptly gets evicted from her house, pick pocketed, taken hostage, then shot. She is \"saved\" by two women (Rena and Shizuka) that are part of an unorthodox help-for-hire organization called Nereids (inspired by the Greek mythological Nereids ). With nowhere to go, Maia joins up with Nereids, taking jobs from capturing wanted criminals to chasing stray cats, often with unexpected results. Gloria and Yu later join up with Nereids.\n\n\"Daphne\" in the title refers to a subplot that starts midway into the series and eventually become important to Maia. \"Brilliant Blue\" refers to the fact that this is a world covered by water with almost no land. The world consists of vast oceans, a few islands, and floating cities.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Living with her guardian in a cottage on Mochi-mochi mountain is Seravi, who is her teacher and also the fictional world's greatest magician. Chacha is clumsy in casting her spells because, throughout the anime, when she summons something, it often turns out to be something that she didn't mean to cast, for example, spiders (kumo) instead of a cloud (also kumo). At times in the anime when she and her friends are in trouble, however, her spells do work. Living on the same mountain is a boy gifted with enormous strength named Riiya. It is described that Riiya came from a family of werewolves who can instantly change into a wolf whenever they want. Quite far from Mochi-mochi mountain lies Urizuri mountain. Dorothy, also a well known magician in her land, lives in a castle on Urizuri mountain. Living with her is Shiine, her student. Shiine is adept when it comes to casting spells. He is a young wizard and most of his knowledge about magic was taught to him by Dorothy.\n\nThe first 2 seasons were originally created by the anime team. Most of the stories in season 3 are based on the manga.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Mana urges Riko to purchase one, and although initially declining, Riko soon avails a few LBX kits for her father.\n\nUpon opening one of the boxes labeled \"LBX Assassin,\" a temporal rift manifests itself and transports Riko into the sky of an alternate Japan. While she falls at terminal velocity, an exosuit based on the LBX Assassin materializes around her, saving her from the descent. However, on the ground, she encounters the Mimesis, lethal metallic creatures that invade world after world. As she flees away from these monsters, Riko is rescued by four other LBX-equipped girls. After learning about Riko's predicament, the group decides to recruit her into their combat unit\u2014\"Soukou Musume.\"\n\nSoukou Musume Senki narrates how the unit endures the trials and tribulations they face, developing unbreakable bonds along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, things have become desperate for our hero, Kazuki; nearly blind now, and partially crippled from his battles with the Festum two years earlier, he clings to the promise his fallen friend Soushi made to him to return to the island and set things right again. Kazuki's hopes flare when a lifeform is detected within an unmanned submarine that comes floating into Tatsumiya Bay one night, but the person aboard isn't Soushi; it is a mysterious \"boy\" named Misao Kurusu who may not be entirely human, and who claims to have been sent by S\u014dshi. With Misao's arrival, hostilities break out anew between the Human Army and the Festum, and the Fafner pilots are thrown into the most desperate battle of their lives - this time, with the fate of TWO races riding on their shoulders. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Kumiho are familiar figures in Korean folk tales, and they are usually depicted as magical creatures that take female form to lure and prey on humans. This time, however, our protagonist is a young, kind-hearted fox with only five tails, instead of nine.\n\nAfter losing her family to fox hunters, five-tailed Yobi lives in the forest with some shipwrecked aliens, far away from the humans. When one of her alien friends gets captured by a villager, Yobi has no choice but to adventure into the human world to rescue him. At the village, Yobi meets many humans, including Geum Yee who studies at a school for maladjusted children. Interested in Geum Yee, Yobi joins the students and revels in the fun of human life, but both a fox hunter and a mysterious shadow man are on her trail.\n\n(Source: YesAsia)",

Seeing Hachi's wit and courage, as well as his convenient ability to perform housework, Joker reluctantly accepts him as a disciple.\n\nAs they set off with their eyes set on the next prize, Joker and Hachi butt heads with other phantom thieves. Facing both old friends and new foes alike, Joker competes to become the best \"magician\" of the shining night.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She later turns out to be his cousin who he barely remembers from his childhood. Urara, who had felt something special for him (an other-than-cousinly-love), invites Touma to live with her since he has no place to stay other than the hotel room. Before taking the test, Touma meets Meiko Yotsuba, a beautiful, sophisticated woman also trying to get into Keio. Meiko gets into Keio but Touma does not, due to a cold Urara had given him shortly before. Although he did not make it, he pretends he does to earn the respect of Meiko. Touma is caught up in a love triangle with Urara and Meiko, while struggling to keep Meiko believing he's really a Keio student and still be there for Urara at the same time. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

Normally, it is simple for them to separate their daily lives from their job, but when they go to investigate a seemingly typical haunting of a pair of twins, a series of bizarre events throw their perception of the supernatural world into question as they become a target of the hauntings themselves.\n\nThe further the brothers search for answers to the paranormal mysteries thrown at them, the hazier the lines between truth and fiction become. Through the challenging and sometimes dangerous adventures ahead, one question remains: what kind of secrets are the ghosts trying to hide from them, and are they already more connected to the spirits than they originally thought?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They find two sets of female antique mummies from Italy around the age of 14\u201320 years old.\n\nOne of the students, Sayaka, rips open the mummy and takes out a stone called \"stone of life,\" which gave the mummies super strength and eternal life. Having stolen their \"stone of life,\" the two mummy girls wake up and become zombies after 100 years in order to get it back in a bloody gruesome way, smashing their heads and eating their flesh for power.\n\nThe only way for the students to get out is to somehow find a way to kill the zombie girls. Will they be able to survive?\n\n(Source: Shochiku)",

Unfortunately, Enno didn't have the strength to defeat her alone and was forced to call upon Zenki, a powerful protector demon. After Karuma was defeated, Enno sealed Zenki away in a pillar located inside his temple.\n\n1,200 years after this epic battle, Enno's descendant, Chiaki, spends her days showing tourists around her hometown of Shikigami-cho and doing exorcisms to pay the bills. One day, two thieves enter the town in hopes of opening a seal in the Ozuno temple and releasing the hidden treasure from within. However, what actually pops out is a dark entity that attaches itself to the henchmen, transforming them into demonic beings. After this transformation, they begin a rampage through the temple, terrorizing poor Chiaki.\n\nIt is now up to this young progeny to unleash her family's powers to summon Zenki and save Shikigami-cho from these demons, as well as the evil entities sure to follow in their footsteps.",

The crew finds out that the group is called the \"Gatlantis,\" and that its leader is the Gutaba expeditionary force commander who calls himself \"Goran Dagaamu of Thunder.\" The commander demands that Yamato be handed over to him. Yamato, wanting to hurry to Earth, escapes the fray. However, Yamato is attacked by a devastating beam weapon called the \"Flame Direct Attack Cannon\" that can transcend space.\n\nYamato was able to retreat, but ends up getting lost, and finds itself in a strangely colored irregular dimension. The crew decides to turn off the engine on the ship, and explore a mysterious planet. In order to collect information, Kodai, Kiry\u016b, Sawamura, Niimi, and Aihara land on the planet. What they saw when they arrived was a ship that was not supposed to be there.\n\nDagaamu chases after the traces of Yamato's warp, and also reaches the strangely colored space. The planet on which Yamato landed was in fact what Dagaamu had been looking for all along.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Slipstream\nAbout a Luftwaffe pilot who must choose between his duty to his country: to guard a bomber loaded with Germany's final hope of victory... the world's first atomic bomb... or his duty to the world: to let it fall in flames to enemy Spitfires and be a footnote in history. Of course, things are complicated by the plane's other cargo... the woman he loves. \n\n2. Sonic Boom Squadron\nNear the end of the war, Japan has implemented a new weapon -- a human-piloted rocket-propelled flying bomb. Aboard a bomber carrying one of these, young Ensign Nogami awaits his chance to die as a \"cherry blossom\", a suicide pilot. In a few hours, he will die. The date of his death is set: August 6, 1945.\n\n3. Knight of the Iron Dragon\nTwo soldiers attempt to reach an air base in order to fulfill a promise despite the fact that it might have been rendered moot in the reality of war.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Instead, they now produce beautiful girls and boys that float joyfully through the air, stimulating other areas of the body instead, whether willing or not. Moans of ecstasy and frenzy reverberate across the world from those desperate to seek relief from their relief.\n \nAlthough the streets run white with bodily fluids, people are far from relieved of their sexual troubles; fortunately, it is the perfect time to search for solutions!

Once every 3,000 years, a supreme being known as the \"Choujin\" (Overfiend) will emerge and bring balance to all three realms on Earth. In present-day Japan, after 300 years of endless searching, a Jujinkai named Amano Jyaku has discovered the presence of the Choujin inside high school slacker Tatsuo Nagumo. But now, Amano, along with his sister Megumi and their sidekick Kuroko, must protect Nagumo and his new girlfriend Akemi Ito from the Makai, who believe that Nagumo is not the Choujin, but an evil entity bent on destroying all living beings on Earth.

Once the war ended, an annual tradition was proposed where a female sacrifice would be taken from the humans to be eaten by the King of Beasts. This tradition continues on as the 99th sacrifice, 15-year-old Sariphi, is taken from her village to the kingdom of Ozmargo, a miasma-filled realm where beasts live and human entry is forbidden.\n\nBut Sariphi is not like the previous sacrifices. Her optimism and lack of fear towards the beasts and her fate surprises the otherwise fearsome King. Intrigued by the sacrificial princess and her history, he allows her to freely roam around the kingdom until the night of revelation despite the potential outrage. Little do Sariphi and the King know, their short time spent together has slowly set the stage for something unimaginably different for the future of Ozmargo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thanks to the legendary hero Shion Bladearts, wielder of Excalibur, and his loyal band of companions, the Gate was sealed off and the demonic threat was vanquished.\n\nUnfortunately, the seal was incomplete and has begun to weaken, allowing the demons to once again begin their attack. Worried about the safety of his village, selfish and perverted farmer Touka Scott dig pitfalls to defend against the demons. But fear not, for Shion is on his way to reseal Hell's Gate and save humanity!\n\nOr at least he was, because the legendary hero is dead, having fallen into one of the pitfalls Touka dug. Luckily, dealing with the dead is the specialty of necromancer Anri Haynesworth. While she can't revive him, Anri can at least salvage their quest by forcing Touka's soul into Shion's rotting body and dragging him along to Hell's Gate in Shion's place. Not wanting to be left behind, Touka's childhood friend Yuna Yunis tags along. Together, the three of them set out as what just might be the most unsuitable party to ever try to save the world!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Then one night, she witnesses a UFO crash in the forest near her home. She rushes to the scene and finds the pilot, codenamed \"D.D.\", in a barely stable condition. Also in the scene is a Maguar, a hideous alien that hatched aboard D.D.'s ship. As the Maguar is close to taking Tsubasa's life, an alien lifeform fuses with her body to form the Riberus battle armor Figure 17, which shortly destroys the alien threat. The life form takes the name Hikaru and turns into an identical twin of Tsubasa. As time passes, Tsubasa becomes more open to everyone around her, thanks to her new twin sister Hikaru. However, with Maguar eggs scattered all over Hokkaido, their ability to form Figure 17 is needed to eliminate all hatched Maguars until backup from D.D.'s home planet arrives on Earth.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

When Goku sees that innocent people are being attacked in his name, he becomes furious. Trunks comes to Goku\u2019s aid, and the two lead the artificial humans out of the city. As the battle is moved elsewhere, Goku and Gohan, now dressed in white tuxes, return and land in West City.\n\nThe two proceed to show clips and highlights from the preceding Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z movies. Goku of course doesn't much like being all dressed up, and by the end he powers up to change back into his typical d\u014dgi. Gohan tries to do the same, but isn't powerful enough to get out of his tux. Goku says he\u2019ll get there someday, and Gohan tells everyone to be sure to go see \u201cExtreme Battle!! The Three Great Super Saiyans\u201d in theaters.\n\n(Source: Kanzenshuu)",

However, because of a conspiracy by the Dragon King to steal the Spirit Pearl for his own son, Ne Zha is instead reincarnated with the Demon Orb.\n\nWith no way to remove the cursed effects of the Demon Orb, Ne Zha is raised under the belief that he will become the great demon hunter the Spirit Pearl destined for him to be. Fighting against his chaotic and mischievous nature, Ne Zha must decide whether to accept his evil fate or rebel against it to prove he is worthy of the future his parents foretold.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She is always worrying about that, so if she is treated like a child, she gets angry. The second sister is Kaname Onee-sama. She is a popular lawyer and is known as the \"Icy Lawyer\". In fact, she is my first love. The third is Serori Ne-Ne. She is half Japanese and half North European. She has the most voluptuous body of all the sisters, but her behavior is very childish. The fourth is Tomoe Ne. Although she looks quite stern, she is actually quite gentle and gets teased by the other sisters. The fifth is Takane Aneki. She is highhanded, and treats me like a servant. She often beats me. The youngest sister is Umi Oneechan. She takes care of me a lot, and devotes much love to me.\n\nWhen I was a child, I was adopted by the Hiiragi family. But because the father was afraid that the sisters would spoil me, I was sent to a relative to train myself. It is the first time I`ve gone home since then. I was very excited to see them again, especially Kaname, my first love.\n\nThey welcomed me home, but late at night, Kaname Onee-sama raped me, and treated me like a toy. I felt very ashamed and I made up my mind to train my sex technique to put her to shame...with the help of the other sisters.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

She performs as an idol like Kokona Saionji (her classmate and close friend) and Tsubasa Kisaragi (an idol who dresses in male clothing). However, unlike Kokona whose popularity is skyrocketing and Tsubasa with her charisma in male attire, Komugi's only gigs are low-end ones like those at the local shopping district. Still, Komugi has her \"dream\" as she lives her dual lives as a idol and a middle school girl.\n\nOne day, a mysterious injured creature named Usa-P appears before Komugi. Komugi gives Usa-P medical treatment, and Usa-P, in consideration of Komugi's kindness, asks if she wants to be a Legendary Girl who can use magical powers.\n\nHaving become a reluctant Legendary Girl, Komugi battles strange masked figures who suddenly appear! As a newly deemed Magical Nurse, she fights still more waves of masked figures. Meanwhile, a Magical Maid, a Magical Sister, and more also appear to make it a three-way battle!? Can Komugi handle the three roles of middle school girl, idol, and Magical Nurse? And, what lies ahead in these battles and her \"dream\"...?!\n\n(Source: ANN)",

The mysterious medallion that Esteban wears since ever has a trace somewhere in the New World, probably coming from the Mysterious Cities of Gold. Esteban leaves Spain to find his parents and find out who he is. On the way he meets Zia, an Inca girl who was kidnapped from her people years back and has exactly the same medallion as him. Later on, they are joined by Tao, a young Galapagos robinson, the last descendant of the Empire of Heva, an Empire said to have built the Cities of Gold. Following Coyolite, the shining star represented on their medallions, the three children travel through the unexplored New World, searching for the Cities of Gold, believing that this way is leading them to their lost parents.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

He carries with him his family's heirloom katana as well as a rather disturbing secret: he can see the spirits of the dead.  Even so, he remains optomistic of the future that lies ahead, musing on how less scary the spirits would be if only they were less frightening in appearance.  When he awakes, he realizes that he may have gotten his half-hearted wish..in part as he finds he's the one that has become significantly smaller and decidely cuter.  As if that's not enough to throw his world into chaos, Kyoichiro soon finds himself swept up into a supernatural dispute between factions of the Imperial Japanese Army intent on creating an army of undead soldiers, a mysterious stranger with vague intentions, and a seemingly anti-government group known as the Five Katana.\n\n[Written by i2isagrl]",

So even if the attack on Prince Richard by a supposed foreign sniper fails to put his royal highness six feet under, it soon becomes clear that it's open hunting season for Royals when assassins strike again. Now Team White Pigeon's priorities must be split between locating the deadly Cavorite bombs smuggled into the country and protecting Princess Charlotte's sister Mary, the next in line... which, given that Charlotte herself is also a target and currently posing as White Pigeon's Ange, only redoubles the peril she's already found herself in! The fuses are primed, and the timers are counting down in the second shocking and explosive installment of Princess Principal: Crown Handler!\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks, edited)",

Unfortunately for our good guy, he was born into a martial arts family whose head (ie his father) only knows one language: violence. When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend's daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth's strongest martial arts clan.\n\nSkip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth. Enter Momoko Kuzuryuu: sugar bomb, airhead, loli martial arts artist and Koushi's self-proclaimed bride (the strongest on Earth, no less). Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi's square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn't have the foggiest idea who she actually is.\n\nMeanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge him. As if that weren't bad enough, our protagonist also has a fight phobia due to a traumatic incident that took place in his childhood. Now it's up to Momoko and her superhuman fighting skills to protect her \"husband.\" Will the two sweethearts survive the trials and tribulations ahead of them? More importantly, will Momoko get her way receiving a baby from Koushi?",

Lowe tries to decrypt some combat data contained in the head, but is shortly engaged by, and goes into combat with, several ZAFT suits including a CGUE DEEP Arms. In the second short, Blue Frame pilot Gai Murakamo engages and, with the help of his fellow Serpent Tail mercenaries, traps a GINN High Mobility Type. He then faces off with the legendary Edward Harrelson, who pilots a Sword Calamity Gundam and has just finished destroying a fleet of ZAFT ships.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Hiroshima is still a ruin, and Gen must scrounge for scrap metal to help keep himself and his remaining family fed, but at least commerce has returned to the land. As his mother gradually grows ill from radiation sickness, Gen and Ryuta befriend a group of orphans led by a tough-nosed older child and including a girl who still bears ugly burn scars from the day of the bomb. An old man suffering from depression is also drawn into the group as they come together to support each other and form a makeshift family. Reality is still harsh, however, as many orphans still die lonely deaths and the grim reminders of what happened linger everywhere.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

The first two were released on DVD bundled with two drama CDs, with the third being sold separately. It is unknown if these will ever be released outside of Japan.\n\nThe first OVA is a re-enactment of the first chapter, where Negi first learns of his job as a teacher and is introduced to the students of Mahora Academy 2-A. It ends with profiles of the Baka Rangers (Asuna, Makie, Yue, Ku Fei and Kaede) as well as Ayaka. Asuna is the only girl in the class that doesn't have romantic feelings for Negi.\n\nThe second OVA is a re-enactment of the \"love potion\" incident of chapter 2, with profiles at the end of Nodoka, Konoka, the cheerleaders (Misa, Madoka, Sakurako) as well as Kazumi.\n\nThe third OVA is a re-enactment of chapter 13: Negi's Mahora tour with the Narutaki twins. The tour shows Negi to several of the students (Yuna, Akira, Chao, Satsuki, Satomi, Chizuru, Natsumi, Zazie) as well as others that he ends up missing (Sayo, Evangeline, Chachamaru, Chisame, Misora, Ako). After being chewed out by Haruna for completely skipping her, a final scene introduces Setsuna and Mana, keeping watch from something on campus.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Meanwhile, the war effort is growing, and it`s only the natural thing to do to be patriotic and support the country...\n\nKayoko goes so far as to contribute her favorite dolly, whose materials could help build explosives. Time passes, and as she grows older, Kayoko sees how the war has affected her life and those around her. Nothing can prepare her for 1945, however, and the bleak times that are soon to come.

The mystery only deepens when they encounter a wandering priest, Hazel Grouse, and his imposing bodyguard, Gaty Nene Hawk. The pair hails from the far West, with Hazel using his powers of resurrection to aid grief-stricken villages. While his ability is greatly welcomed by the people, the truth behind it is less miraculous than it seems. Furthermore, the resurrected humans gain golden eyes, a trait they share with the group's recent attackers. It appears that the friendly priest's intentions are not as generous as one might expect\u2014and the Sanzou party is a step away from unraveling them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Takasugi Shinsaku, a soldier of fortune from Choshu, sneaks aboard a government ship with his comrade Katsura Kogorou in search of a mysterious \"timepiece\" with the power to manipulate time that he fears the government wishes to keep for themselves. Rather than allow such power to fall into the wrong hands, Takasugi plans to destroy the artifact, but having obtained it, the artifact is quickly stolen, forcing the pair to follow the mysterious thief to the seat of government in Kyoto. However, when they arrive in the capital, they discover that the government has been overthrown and the deity Susanoo now reigns in its place. The streets of the city and the people in them are much different than Takasugi and Katsura remembered. The times may have changed but their mission hasn't - Takasugi and Katsura resolve to reset time and save their nation from the nefarious forces trying to hijack it.\n\n(Source: Tokyo Otaku Mode)",
