Known to be the first to climb the Stairway to Heaven, he was expected to become the leader of gods.\n\nHowever, Jiang Ziya's final task to execute the Nine-Tailed soon took a turn for the worse when the demon created an illusion and showed Jiang Ziya an innocent girl trapped inside her. Growing doubtful, he freed the fox spirit to save the girl. As a punishment for his transgression, Jiang Ziya was banished to the North Sea, with his divine power sealed, until he would no longer be plagued by the Nine-Tailed's mirage.\n\nTen years later, Jiang Ziya dwells in the North Sea alongside his friend Shen Gongbao and his pet Si Bu Xiang. At a bar, Jiang Ziya meets Xiao Jiu\u2014who resembles the girl from the illusion. When he asks her about the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon's bracelet on her ankle, she tells him that the accessory reveals to her a place where black flowers bloom. Conflicted over what to believe, Jiang Ziya accompanies Xiao Jiu to Mount Youdu. Thus, the two begin a formidable journey that might uncover not only the truth Jiang Ziya has been searching for, but also shocking facts about the great war of the past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When the moment of truth comes, however, Youko is not brave enough to speak to her classmate, and the ground suddenly swallows her up!\n\nIn an instant, Youko finds herself in the mysterious realm of \"Ashanti.\" She quickly makes friends with a talking dog named Lingam, who explains that Ashanti is a sister realm of \"Noa,\" the realm that Youko came from. The two worlds were once connected, but they were separated long ago by the warrior Leda in order to protect the people of Noa. Now, Youko's arrival has temporarily opened a path between the realms, which the evil forces of Zell intend to make permanent.\n\nThe forces of Zell steal Youko's cassette player under the belief that it is the mythical \"Heart of Leda,\" a necessary artifact for their nefarious plans. However, Youko manages to evade their capture by transforming into Leda's warrior. With these new powers, will she be able to protect the people of Noa and return to her own world?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The ancient civilization vanished ages ago, and a few of its remnants still exist as myths and legends called UMAs (unidentified lifeforms). The UMAs begin merging with humans in order to search for the treasures of Mu, the powerful ooparts, which will give them the power to revive Mu. After Subaru and War-Rock encounter several unusual enemies, they meet a professor named Doctor Orihime who sends them on a quest to find the ooparts and stop the UMAs. Using the ooparts, Rockman is able to take new forms, including Thunder Berserk, Fire Dinosaur, and Green Shinobi. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Main differences are the exclusion of Tetsuro and his replacement by Mizuki, The replacement of Lisker with a female Agent \"Valcuria\", and thus a female Guyver 2. There is also a look at Sho's psychology of how he deals with his situation including a very harsh moment where his friends are assassinated in cold blood.\n\nOne night, high school student Sho Fukamachi discovers a mysterious metal object. Then in a blinding flash of light, Sho finds that he has accidentally fused with the Guyver, a mecha of mysterious alien design.\n\nNow, to save his girlfriend, Mizuki Segawa, along with the entire world, Sho must become the Guyver to fight the Chronos Corporation and their biocreatures, called Zoanoids, who are hell-bent on world domination.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

However, the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union have not ended; rather, they've escalated as both sides build military facilities in space, and the shadow of nuclear conflict looms over humanity, both on and off Earth.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Red Planet, an exchange program created by the United Nations to promote peace and understanding is about to begin; the \"Cosmic Culture Club,\" consisting of 16 boys and girls, as well as their instructor Elizabeth, arrives at the UN Mars base. Among the passengers is Anna a 14-year-old girl who serves as the narrator for the story.\n\nSuddenly, four unidentified humanoid robots classified as Super Powered Tracers are detected, engaged in fierce combat with each other. The UN base is caught in the crossfire and quickly destroyed, killing all but six members of the \"Cosmic Culture Club\"\u2014Elizabeth, Arthur, Roan, David, Simone and Anna, and leaving them stranded on an inhospitable planet that has suddenly become a battlefield. As the battle ends, the lone SPT standing lands next to the terrified group and opens up revealing a pilot, who simply announces to them, \"Earth is at stake.\"",

When the war ended, there was only one ruling family - that of the Oowaris, and the remaining son gained control of all the moons of heaven, except for one. Meiten, the moon of the pope, where people refrained from war and were therefore out of it's terms.\n\nEight people. Each from one of the eight moons. Each possessing one of the jewels - the elements that compose Earth. They are those who are destined to become saviors of humanity. All of them have sacrificed for these jewels, and are determined to complete their duty to Queen Fuse who entrusted these to them. When the mad emperor Kai threatens to revive a ghost who wants to prevent the restoration of Earth, these eight must battle using the powers given by their jewels in order to create Earth and defeat those who want to prevent it.\n\nSo they all go to Kusanagi, the ship in the center of God's land. They must gather the jewels in the key called Yatsufusa at Kusanagi's center, in order to create Earth.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Following this development, the Soviet Security Force (SSF) was formed to establish humanity's presence throughout the galaxy. Among the SSF's many divisions is the Special Armored Company (SAC) #101. Using powerful mobile humanoid weapons called \"Armored Knights,\" these female enforcers dispense justice upon corrupt officials, crime lords, and other villainous forces threatening public order.\n\nSoukou Kijo Iris follows Iris Rebel, a lieutenant of SAC #101, as her squad investigates reports of trafficking activities on the planet Left. After her Elven partner Mei Li Naceri suddenly goes missing in action, Iris narrowly escapes an ambush and loses consciousness. After being captured by Orcs and taken to an underground slave auction, she is thoroughly humiliated by gleeful bidders before being sold off for an exorbitant price to Bozuk, owner of the most renowned brothel in Dark Town. Now forced into a life of prostitution, Iris must attempt to seek out her partner before the pleasures brought by her clients drive her to the brink of insanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Following the proverb \"use poison to defeat poison,\" using Kikou to defeat Kikou appears to be mankind's last hope. Nine years later, a new weapon named the Muttsu is created from the research, and it is almost ready for use in live combat. A boy, Rin Sagami, and a girl, Yuzuru Midou, are chosen to ride the Muttsu. They are entrusted with the hopes for the future of mankind, but they face the mission with courage. However, what awaits the two is a cruel fate.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

Advanced robots have survived the apocalypse, and Haruka lives with five who care for her: Spike, a boyish android who is very attached to her; Trigger, hot-tempered with a penchant for firearms; Cleric, the intelligent problem solver; Reeves, whose thoughtfulness overshadows his intimidating appearance; and Angela, a sword wielding recluse with an aversion towards humans. Residing in a high-rise building at the center of the city, Haruka lives a relatively peaceful life with her mechanical family.\n\nHowever, her life is far from a stable one. Not only is a lack of resources a concern, but violent, remnant robots from the war roam free, ready to destroy whomever they meet. Kurogane Communication follows Haruka as she tries to survive in an apocalyptic world while facing many dangers that will challenge her daily life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Learning to love, Marion blossoms under his older lover's care but unfortunately, Marion has yet to learn the true price of the affair.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Rushing to fill the quotas, the owner of Studio Petit hires Takashimadaira, a veteran producer to help Kuromi. However, all Takashimadaira cares about is making deadlines, severely hurting the quality of the images. Shihonmatsu, who has been helping Kuromi, gets angry at the new producer and leaves, leaving Kuromi with a difficult choice: to choose between the quality or the deadline.\nStudio Petit managed to survive the production of \"Time Journeys,\" but now that show's finished, and in its place they've got no less than three series to animate, with just four artists, one manager and one director - not to mention one very bedraggled animation runner. And it doesn't help that Shihonmatsu picked this week to quit smoking. As the staff starts to fall behind their crushing deadlines, the owner calls in an old \"pro,\" Takashimadaira, to get production back on track. But once he starts putting speed above quality, the Petit team has to choose between following orders and doing their jobs right.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

However, the principal who understood my way of teaching became sick, and hospitalized. Then, the vice-principal, Migiwa Anzu, took over the job. However, her educational policy was to make the students enter elite university, and my ideal education was broken. I was discouraged and became a bad teacher, and then even students began to make a fool of me. One day, I was scolded for the mistake I made in the class by the five female teachers who subordinated Ms. Migiwa. Then, I was dropped from homeroom teacher, and I began to just watch another teacher`s class. Since that day, my humiliating days began.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

They are, however, in no way related to each other, except for some indication of previous OVAs by Hinagiku and Yuri.

The next day he discussed with the family their holiday plans, only to realize he could not find the place anywhere on earth.

Better still, it's absolutely free. However, it seems that there is a hidden agenda behind the person who invites them there.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

This couldn't be any worse, as the object of her affection is her oblivious classmate Haruka Kokonose. With their dispositions, Takane will never confess and Haruka will never notice. Maybe, however, she will finally be able to muster the courage to convey her feelings for him before the sun sets.\n\nOuter Science\nWithin the Heat Haze Daze, Kuroha rests beside his imprisoned former master, awaiting the next master\u2014Mari Kozakura. No matter how she tries to rewrite the future, Mari is inevitably faced with tragedy, desperate to save those who matter most to her. But despair is never-ending, and what awaits her is an endless cycle of anguish. Not that it matters, as Kuroha will always be waiting.\n\nSummer Time Record\nAs the story of the Mekakushi-dan draws to a close, its members reminisce of times gone by. These children, who may have never met otherwise, are connected by the past. However, as they finally approach the end, they resolve to remember, hoping to one day meet again.\n\nShounen Brave\nKousuke Seto lacks courage more than anything else. Relentlessly bullied, his only friend is a dog, with whom he shares a bond that needs no words. However, this solace is destroyed by a tragedy, which burdens Seto with the red-eye power to hear others' thoughts. Haunted by the hurtful things he hears, he runs off, leading him to a fateful encounter. If it is for the sake of this person, Seto may finally have what it takes to be a little brave.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

The truth of this is hammered in when Masato sees his parents accept payment for raising him. The Last Guardian is preparing for the resurrection of \"Hau Dragon\", an organization bent on world conquest. 15 years ago, Hau Dragon built 8 great robots. Each of the mecha represents a force of nature. However, before any of the robots could be used, their creater Kihara Masaki destroyed the robots except for the leader: Zeorymer. He took Zeorymer and an embryo to the government. The embryo became the boy Masato. Now, Hau Dragon has rebuilt the other 7 mecha and wants the 8th. It will be up to Masato and Himuro to pilot Zeorymer and fight against the Hau Dragon, but neither Masato or Himuro are all that they seem. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ",

However, the inhabitants of Pasatorine have initiated something called the \"Cleopatra Plan.\" Puzzled why an alien planet would name a plan after a woman from Earth, the military decides to send three soldiers' minds back to the past to study Cleopatra's life.\n\nThe Kingdom of Egypt, led by the drunkard Ptolemy, is threatened by Julius Caesar and the Roman empire. In an attempt to save Egypt, Cleopatra, the younger sister of Ptolemy, chooses to undergo a procedure that makes her body irresistible to Caesar. Caesar is immediately smitten and desires to rule Egypt with Cleopatra at his side\u2014but little does he know that she intends to assassinate him as soon as she can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In hopes of returning the furniture after attempting to stuff it in a corner of her tiny apartment, she calls her mother to complain about the sudden burden, but her mom only vaguely tells Noel that it is \"her turn.\"\n\nWhen Noel returns from a night of drinking, she finds a fat child in her apartment eating her food. Shocked and confused, she eventually discovers that her mother's wardrobe contains six strange children who claim to serve the current mistress of the Hiiragi family. Refusing to buy this blunt explanation, Noel struggles to adapt to her new lifestyle, wondering whether the children's service is a blessing or a curse.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It is called \"Dancougar Nova\". Some even call it God. \n\nHowever, no one knows the reason for its existence - not even its pilots. \nThen, another robot, beyond anyone's expectations, reveals itself as the true enemy and begins its attack on the Earth. \n\nDancougar Nova retaliates against this enemy with a power that was kept secret until now. Will Dancougar Nova be able to save the Earth? The prelude to this explosive confrontation rings out. \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

Already overburdened by his day-to-day responsibilities, it seems like her father gets called in to do last-minute work every weekend. Even if he somehow manages a break, his crippling fear of the ocean would prevent him from truly enjoying the beach with his daughter.\n\nAfter yet another postponement, Mika plays in a kiddie pool alone, with only Juju, an inflatable dugong, to keep her company. But things take a turn for the bizarre when Juju comes to life and tells Mika that he will take her to the ocean in her father's place. As Mika hangs on to Juju for dear life, she wonders if her trip is more than what she bargained for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although his mother is allergic to cats and has a great fear of them, she agrees to let him keep the kitten because she fears he is becoming too withdrawn after failing his university entrance exams. Chibi-neko soon falls in love with Tokio.\n\nIn her own mind, Chibi-neko is a small human who speaks in human words, although people only ever seem to hear her meow, and she believes that all humans were once kittens like her. A stray cat tells Chibi-neko of a paradise called Cottonland, where dreams can come true.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Shiraishi's teammate, Koharu Konjiki, decides to tag along in hopes of being able to see his crush. Instead, Konjiki ends up becoming infatuated with both Tezuka and Atobe and struggles to pick between the two.\n\nFuji Kyoudai no Houkago (Fuji Brothers After School)\nSeishun's Shuusuke Fuji asks his younger brother Yuuta to go shopping with him to pick out a present for their older sister's birthday. As they proceed with their plans, Yuuta's teammates from the St. Rudolph Academy tennis team catch a glimpse of the two brothers and initially think nothing of it. However, St. Rudolph's manager, Hajime Mizuki, misinterprets the situation and believes Shuusuke is trying to get Yuuta to transfer back to Seishun. In an effort to stop his plans, Hajime forces the team to secretly follow the brothers around.\n\nInitial A\nRikkai University-Affiliated Middle School's Akaya Kirihara always seems to get himself into sticky situations. Out on a shopping trip with Bunta Marui and Jackal Kuwahara, Kirihara bumps into Seishun's Takashi Kawamura, causing a stuffed toy Kawamura was carrying to go flying into a nearby dog's mouth. The two begin to chase the dog in order to get the toy back. Kawamura later recounts the story to Yamabuki Middle School's Jin Akutsu, who seems less than enthused about the ordeal.\n\nKai\u2606Para\nSeishun's Eiji Kikumaru shows up to morning tennis practice tired after staying up late at night to play Kai\u2606Para, a new online game. Vice-captain Shuichirou Oishi seems perplexed by the concept of an online game, which shocks his teammates. Eiji convinces his doubles partner to log onto the game later that night but fails to tell him the full name of the game, causing Oishi to play a different game instead that uses the same moniker.\n\nNagisa no Motemote Watching (Beachside's Popular Watching)\nRokkaku Middle School's tennis captain, Kentarou Aoi, is jealous of his teammate Kojirou Saeki and Yamabuki's Kiyosumi Sengoku, both of whom can effortlessly attract women. Overhearing his troubles, Shitenhouji's Konjiki decides to tell him the secrets to winning over a woman's heart.\n\nOmae no Kimochi ga Wakaranai (I Don't Understand Your Feelings!)\nAfter coming to afternoon practice late, Hyoutei Academy's Choutarou Ootori accidentally overhears the team's third years discussing who will become the captain once they graduate. Ootori's doubles partner, Ryou Shishido, states that between him and Wakashi Hiyoshi, he would choose Hiyoshi to lead Hyoutei. This upsets Ootori greatly and the two end up fighting during practice. In an effort to cool down, Shishido sets out to train on his own but runs into Seishun's Kaoru Kaidou, who offers his two cents on his situation.\n\nDocchi no Megane Show (Whose Glasses Are These?)\nAfter knocking over a display stand, Higa Middle School's Yuujirou Kai bumps into Hyoutei's Hiyoshi, knocking his contact right out of his eye. As Hiyoshi searches for his missing contact, his teammate Yuushi Oshitari and Seishun's Sadaharu Inui begin to argue over what type of glasses would best suit him.\n\nUnabara-matsu! (The Ocean Festival)\nSeishun's Ryouma Echizen and Takeshi Momoshiro are invited by Rikkai's Genichirou Sanada to their school's Ocean Festival. The tennis team is putting on a \"Cinderella\" play for the festival with Kirihara playing the main role, though the second-year ace is reluctant to be wearing a frilly pink dress for the part.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

His work straddles a weird boundary between avant-garde experimentation and low-brow fart jokes\u2014the punchline of one of these films is literally an oozing torrent of shit\u2014although, admittedly, his videos seem to lean a bit more heavily towards the fart jokes than his comics. But hey, who doesn't appreciate a good fart joke once in a while?\n\n(Source: Only the Cinema blog)",

The only one left was Ako's friend Suzu, who explained how Aphrodite suddenly changed and took away all music from the land. Ako and Mephisto, unbelieving and determined to find out the truth, headed to the palace where Aphrodite was. Hibiki, Kanade and Ellen decided to chase after Suzu, who had run away after Ako refused to believe her story.\n\nWhile chasing after Suzu, the girls met with 3 men eager to steal the Healing Chest.

However, he cannot do this alone and enlists the aid of Chihaya, a middle school student, who is \"the only one\" who can help him. With his aid she transforms into Magical Warrior Carmine in order to save the humans possessed by the seeds. Questions abound though, such as why Chihaya's mother appears to know all about this secret activity, why Chihaya remembers her father who reportedly died before her birth, and why she dreams of Evergreen, which she has never seen. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

(#1: Chou Denji Robo Combattler V, #2: Chou Denji Machine Voltes V)\n\nAfter the destruction of their home world, the survivors of the planet Barm head toward Earth with the goal of negotiating the purchase of land to emigrate to. Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Barmian's leader, Leon, is assassinated by his second in command, Olban, and the delegation from Earth is framed for the murder. In the ensuing chaos, Doctor Isamu Ryuuzaki of the Earth delegation is shot and killed.\n\nShortly after the disastrous end of the talks, the Barmians (called \"Valerians\" in Starbirds) begin a campaign of terror against Earth, lead by Leon's son, Admiral Richter, who deploys a variety of \"Mecha Soldiers\" against the planet's defenses. The only thing standing between the Earthlings and annihilation is the transforming, karate-using super robot, Daimos, and its pilot, Kazuya Ryuuzaki. But that changes when he meets and falls in love with a mysterious girl named Erika, who turns out to be Richter's sister. Over the course of their struggles to reunite, Kazuya and Erika each learn that the other's people are not all evil... and that their own people are not all good.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
