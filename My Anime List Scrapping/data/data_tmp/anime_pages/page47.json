No wonder the little public drivers admire our \"chest hair\". I don\u2019t know that Lin Xiongmao\u2019s job hunting life in Beijing will look like a magical horse. Maybe it\u2019s like \"Tired\" (quoted from the album \"China Fire I\") sung by the Red Troops in the play: \"I want to be strong, but also stubborn. , But I don\u2019t have the courage, my mind is gray. Time is like running water, time is so precious, today you and I still don\u2019t know anything.\"\n\"Chest Hair\" is nineteen years old and is a Beipiao nationality. He is good at adult comics and he is good at adult comics. When applying for a job in the Imperial Capital, he must have a back seat in the car. You must buy two tickets depending on your weight and height. MT's, to be honest, 19-year-old Lin Xianmao does not only eat, but P can't (the MS stunt is to shake his face). The next day, I left the Ming Tombs and took a black car to a small animation-making unit to apply. Because the paintings were too unsuitable for young children (not conducive to the growth of young people ==~!), I had to choose when the boss went away. Be a security guard at the entrance of the station. Lin's chest hair hits the wall everywhere in the workplace. He has a simple personality, lacks a brain, and is slow to respond. Except for a face that looks like a hip, it seems that everything he does is wrong~~~\nLin Xiongmao also has tenderness. He didn't reveal the hardships of life to the call from home, saying that everything was okay. On the first day of work, because there was no place to live, he had to sleep in the company. During the time, Lin Xiongmao turned over the boss's drawer (found a \" \"The Queen and the Five Men\" film, I found it was a Saint Seiya when I was stunned~~~), the boss sympathized with him and let him stay for one night. When the boss locked the door and left, the panda realized that he was in a hurry, but Found no place to defecate. . . The next day, colleague Ah Meng (Despicable Marvis) found shit in the lunch box and urine in the soda bottle. . . ~~~ (In order to condemn Amon\u2019s questioning, Brother Xiongmao drank the liquid in the bottle very aggressively ==~!) Later, Xiongmao accidentally forgot his stool in the restaurant when he had lunch. The Northeast boss chased him wildly! In the end, he was punished to volunteer for a part-time job in the restaurant, and the original boss paid him.\nWith a grudge, Ah Meng sent a friend \"called a beast\" to stop him in the middle of the night and blackmailed him away for more than 100 yuan~~~~~Because he did not have a temporary residence permit, he was chased by police on the street~~~~~ It rained night to avoid the rain. Wrongly hiding in the \"hair salon\" (he thought it was a haircut ==~!) ~~~~~ I sent my colleague Xiaota home but found that Xiaota sister was a hair salon girl~~~~~~\n\u3000\u3000 In this way, in a very two-stage plot, his chest hair began his bitter life in Beijing~~~~~~(translated from douban)",

A 'full' version was released the following year but contains very little recycled footage, essentially giving her two significantly different debut videos. \n\nThe main purpose of Midori-chan is to promote the Myslot (\u30de\u30a4\u30b9\u30ed) app which allows people to register their gaming through their mobile device which uses QR Codes to let players see and archive their gaming statistics. It also allows users to win prizes, be ranked against others, play minigames (in the app), collect trophies, and find fellow pachinko friends.\n\nMidori-chan has also gone on to have her own digital 4-koma manga (2 different ones), LINE stickers, a book, and apparel line.",

        "synopsis": "The story will revolve around the virtual and real life, work, and feelings of the male protagonist Xiao Sa, telling an inspirational story of game players. The film is actually somewhat suspenseful and very realistic at the same time. I am afraid that for some viewers, this film is very literary. Although it is interspersed with majestic virtual worlds and various entanglements in the virtual world from time to time, this film , The description of contemporary young people is fairly successful.\nThis film pays great attention to the portrayal of characters, delicate performances, and emphasizes the concept of virtual actors. The era is moving more and more towards virtualization. Whether it is the booming development of the game industry or the virtual era that is constantly emphasized in major movies, it is slow Slowly emerges the concept that virtual actors will replace real actors? This will be a new movie model that may emerge. \"Avatar\" is doing a great job. With the advancement of technology, the cost will become smaller and smaller. It is naturally impossible for us to compare with any big movie that is really going to the theater. Just sneaked out a small step in this direction.\nTherefore, in this film, we focus on depicting people and depicting a vivid virtual actor. The story itself is not a shocking event that saves the world and fights the devil. It starts from our lives, from the most basic, and talks about our players. The story, this is the first time our crew has produced a film in the mode of a movie. The engineering files produced by this film are more than all 7 episodes of \"Warriors of the Alliance\". The film length has reached 30 minutes, and the screen is more than \"Warriors\". With a qualitative leap, the action design has completely opened the distance. The plot has been carefully designed. Maybe some viewers may not understand it, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Since the film runs only 30 minutes, we can\u2019t talk too much. Complete, but every shot, every line, every plot has been designed, and the audience may find the answer in the film, or find the answer in reality.\n(translated from douban)",

The younger brother, Yamahiko, made his living hunting birds and animals in the mountains.\n\nOne day Yamahiko said to Umihiko, \"Why don't we exchange my bow and arrows for your fishing tackle, and trade places?\" After bothering him enough Umihiko agreed. The next day proved treacherous as they were unskilled. Umihiko hurt his arm and Yamahiko lost the fishing hook. Umihiko was extremely angered that Yamahiko's trade caused him to loose his prized hook, so even when his arm heals he'd never be able to fish again the same. Yamahiko strives to right his wrongs.",

In the shorts' story, the Seven Gods of Fortune slack in their duties in heaven, and Susanoo-no-Mikoto banishes them to Awaji Island. In order to return to the heavenly realm, they must help bring happiness to humans and rebuild their virtue. The outcast gods reluctantly grant human wishes and accumulate points in their \"god phones\" to be able to return to heaven. They aim to perform good deeds on particularly auspicious days to maximize point accumulation. Despite their best efforts at accumulating virtue, sometimes the Seven Gods of Fortune end up bringing misfortune to humans. When they fail, they lose points, further prolonging their stay on Awaji Island.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Only the infant baby of Zhao Dun's grandson was rescued by Cheng Ying. After Tu Anjia discovered that someone had secretly rescued the orphan, he actually ordered the massacre of all children over one and a half months old in the country. In order to protect the orphans and children from all over the country, Cheng Ying resolutely sacrificed his son to pretend to be the orphan. In the end, the son of the old minister Gongsun Chujiu and Cheng Ying were killed, and the Zhao orphan was saved. Cheng Ying took the orphans to hide in Tibet for 15 years. After that, Zhao Wu, who grew up, with the help of ministers, punished Tu Anjia and avenged his blood and hatred. Cheng Ying drew his sword to comfort his dead relatives and friends...(translated from douban)",

To the north are the tall and barren Gobi Mountains and sandy deserts, and the middle is full of dense trees. The forests and the grasslands with an infinite view, the south is the hills of strange peaks and strange ridges. For hundreds of years, the United Kingdom of the Desert Dead in the North and the United Kingdom of the Desa City-State in the South have been in confrontation and warfare for a long time, and countless heroes have risen and died in the flames of war. In order to maintain the balance of power and peace on the Dunyuk continent, the primitive races who guarded the forest and the peace-loving heroes established the Union of Guardians. They separated the Civil War by guarding the forest. At the same time, it also makes the forest for balance full of complex and difficult battles.\nThere are mainly eight races living in Dunyuk: the Stanks who are good at magic, the blue blood who are good at gunpowder, the alien bears who are good at speed, the powerful desert dead in the north, and the Desa people who established the Desa dynasty in the south. Medieval Han people in the mountains and forests, as well as the Qiman and Giants (translated from tenceng)",

After being promoted to the immortal, the Jade Emperor invited a celestial master for the twelve zodiac signs to teach various skills and knowledge. However, the Chinese zodiac signs are inert and reborn after making great contributions, living a free and unlearned life in the heavenly court. This situation was caught by the god Erlang, who was patrolling the heaven, and played the Jade Emperor. At the same time as the tribute, the Jade Emperor received a celestial book. The principles explained in the book shocked and approved the Jade Emperor. In order for the Chinese zodiac signs to help him manage the growth rings of the world for a long time, the Jade Emperor plans to take all the zodiac signs from the \"Shen Yu Luo Yan\" pool. After receiving the news, Emperor Qingyun and Mo Jie rushed to intercede for the zodiac signs. While the Jade Emperor refused to forgive the zodiac signs, he agreed to Mo Jie\u2019s suggestion to recall the zodiac when his practice was completed through the time plate scoring method. .

In order to return to the heavens as soon as possible, the five zodiac signs made a series of jokes in the animal village that are ridiculous but crooked, and the story of the five blessings has kicked off...(translated from iqiyi)",

The final ep of these recaps also uses footage from Transformers Headmasters and Transformers: Choujin Master Force into the narrative, most of which are repurposed as new events occurring concurrently with the story line. \n\n(Source: TF Wiki)",

Like other new-style troops across the country, they pinned the Qing Dynasty\u2019s last hope to maintain its shaky rule.\n\u3000\u3000 At this time in Wuchang City, the activities of a group of mysterious people added tension to the city. This group of people are collectively called the Revolutionary Party, and they belong to three different organizations-the Japanese Association, the Gongjin Society, and the Literary Society. With the cover of church activities and literary activities, they secretly planned a violent revolution. In order to succeed, the Revolutionary Party came up with the genius idea of \u200b\u200brecruiting soldiers from the new army to join the revolution. They gradually gathered uprising forces within the army, while waiting for the opportunity of the revolution...\n\u3000\u3000 In May, a mass movement took place in the neighboring province of Sichuan. The tense ruler hurriedly dispatched some new troops from Wuchang to suppress it. The military strength in Wuchang city declined, and the Revolutionary Party felt that the time for an uprising had arrived. However, the process of the uprising was full of twists and turns: When the leader of the Revolutionary Party deployed the uprising arrangement, the soldiers of the Nanhu Pao Camp in Chengnan accidentally leaked news of the uprising due to drinking and making trouble. The revolution failed for the first time; the Revolutionary Party manufactured explosives in the Hankou Concession. At the time, the operation error caused the bomb to explode, the list of revolutionary party members was searched, the leader of the revolutionary party was forced to flee the city, and the revolutionary plan failed for the second time; the revolutionary party decided to advance the uprising, but the ruler blocked the whole city and the news of the uprising was not available It was communicated to the soldiers in time, and the uprising plan failed for the third time; during this period, the ruler launched a hysterical counterattack, conducted a large-scale search of the city, and killed the backbone of the Revolutionary Party...\n\u3000\u3000 In the most critical time, the soldiers at the bottom were determined to save themselves. In the evening of October 10th, the uprising broke out with a gunshot from the soldiers of the uprising. Soldiers from all military camps heard the gunshots and all took part in the action. They aimed their artillery at the Governor's Mansion. After fierce fighting, the Qing army retreated steadily and high-ranking officials fled. In the early morning of the 11th, the entire Wuchang city was completely controlled by the Revolutionary Party. At dawn, the 18-star flag of the Revolutionary Party was planted on the tower of Wuchang.\n\u3000\u3000 On October 17, 1911, a ceremony to symbolize victory and a call for revolution to the whole country was held in Wuchang Yuemachang. People were very excited. This uprising and the ensuing national revolution put an end to China's monarchy for more than two thousand years.\n(translated from douban)",

While facing her death, Matsuwakamaru is puzzled at where people go when they die. If there is a cycle of heaven, hell, and rebirth, is there a way to escape this torturous circle, he wonders. With this great determination for the discovery of knowledge in mind, at only 9 years old, he joins a Buddhist monastery on Mt. Hiei, and changes his name to Shinran. This is the story of the man who would someday open the doors to the Joudo Shinshuu sect of Buddhism.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Though born to a wealthy family in Izumozaki, Ryoukan chooses to abandon the easy life he would have inherited in order to understand the true meaning of life through the teachings of Buddhism. From his early adulthood, he undergoes a series of harsh training that demands a solitary and meager lifestyle. Throughout it all, he remains an extremely modest and humble person, a true humanitarian who accepts every individual for who they are while rejecting all worldly fame and wealth. Ryoukan found true peace in life through nature and spending time with children. His pure mind and affable personality have captivated many, and his legacy and the wisdom of his teachings live on today.\n\n(Source: ATTKC)",
