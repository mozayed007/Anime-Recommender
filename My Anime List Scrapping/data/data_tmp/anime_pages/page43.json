Most of the Earth has been contaminated and is collapsing into ruin, and a great majority of plants and animals are now extinct. The world heads to the \"Big Six,\" the sixth mass extinction event. Humanity built cities in the sky, migrating the endangered species of animals and plants there. Over many years, the animals evolved in these isolated cities. With artificial genetic crossbreeding, they acquire language, bipedality, and build a life and civilization for themselves free from want. No one thinks of the world below any longer. One day, a single plant seed wanders into one of the sky cities, and the children Kui, Hiruma, and Root discover it. Unable to resist the temptation to look into the world outside, they decide to undertake an adventure to the outside world, unknowing that once they set foot on the ground, they will never be able to return.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

In a sports anime that pitches caricatures of real-life players against cartoon characters, the Lions (whose real-life mascot is the grown-up Kimba the White Lion), keep losing games due to Tabuchi's poor condition-his shadow is getting paler. \nA group of fellow players turns up at the stadium, accompanied by Dokaben, and they encourage Tabuchi to pull through. They organize a Tabuchi Day to show him how appreciated he is, but it is a miserable failure.\nEventually, he is brought out of his depression by the arrival of a girl called Miyoko, who obliges by dressing up as a cheerleader.\n\nNote: Real-life members of the Seibu Lions baseball team are caricatured.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

When Hasegawa starts confiding his woman troubles to Emily, she introduces him to Virtuacall, a service that lets you interact with the girl of your dreams just as you wish you could. Unfortunately, Hasegawa becomes more interested in Virtuacall than her as a result. On the verge of leaving the country for her homeland, Emily is so overcome by emotion that she can neither tell Hasegawa about her feeling or tell him that she is leaving.",

The video features a song completely in English with Japanese subtitles. As stated by the company president, Takahisa Takahara, is that women spend 6 yrs and 9 months menstruating their entire lives. With advancing gender roles and longer lifespans, more women are staying in the work place and having more periods. Mensuration causes hormonal mood swings like that of a cranky edgy prickly hedgehog, starving craving hungry black bear, fragile crying [bloated] elephant, and reclusive lonely lion. These are normal changes and the women are still themselves. It promotes body positivity and how women shouldn't be brushed off in the work place if they are having an effect from a biological function that they have to go through for 6 yrs and 9 months.",

Remaining on its own feet and shutting down the country, this country has long been behind the times without knowing it. Of course, in the era of drastic changes, there are still people who try to open their eyes to the world and show the beauty of the world with the culture that their country is proud of. In 1851, the first World Expo was held in London, England. Chinese businessman Xu Rongcun won gold and silver medals with \"Rongji Lake Silk\". A hundred years later, Hu Sizi, a descendant of Xu Rong Village, dismissed the silk crafts handed down by the family. He is obsessed with modern technology and is eager to build sophisticated robots, but he has no spirit of teamwork.\n\u3000\u3000 After suffering a setback, he inadvertently entered the mysterious world of ancient silk, so he embarked on a strange journey...(translated from douban)",

Shiba-wanko is a very gentle and hardworking soul who does all of the cleaning, laundry and cooking in the house. Miike-nyanko is a different type all together, being rather temperamental and not very good with housework.

When he lightly pressed his hand on the code, the code immediately exerted its magical power, involving the little prince, his guard, the big ear cow, and the palace pet, into the world of the code... In this way, the little prince and his party began their code. The first stop of the journey-the submarine washing method.(translated from douban)",

The flash of the A-bomb, 100 times brighter than the sun, is called \"PICA\", and the enormous shock wave which came right after the flash is called \"DON\". At the time this film was completed, it was the very first attempt in the world to deal with such a sensitive subject of Hiroshima using animation media. Because of this short film, the City of Hiroshima decided to establish the Hiroshima International Animation Festival in 1984, appreciating animation art as an effective medium.\n\n(Source: flickerfest.com.au)",

Goethe continues to be responsible for the work of transporting children to and from school. Although Didi and their friends have grown up, they have new problems. There is also an endless stream.

The view from the top of a tall tree, it was lovely. But, there was danger waiting.\n\nA good older sister and brother came to pick fireflies and tried to catch the disabled firefly. \"Dangerous!\" Having a firefly that can not move to save itself, a brave firefly jumped into the hand of a boy as a self-sacrifice.\n\nBut, they were kind-hearted children. They came to get fireflies for their sister who was unable to walk because of a lame foot. In the room where the light was turned off, fireflies shined brightly. This day, fireflies and the hearts of the children were in unison and spoke with each other.\n\n\"Fireflies, come and see me again\" said the little disabled sister. From the children's window, they saw the hordes of fireflies that came lit up shining like an aurora.",

The animation of \"Variety School Bus\" uses a fun and vivid way to answer children's growth problems, and at the same time establish a deep friendship and trust with the children. Now, in the third season of the brand new \"Variety School Bus\", the Variety School Bus will continue to accompany the children's experience and growth, and protect their smiles! \n(translated from iqiyi)",

However, the series never materialized and only this episode was actually aired. The story follows Stevenson's \"Treasure Island,\" featuring characters in the form of animals. For example, the pirate Silver is illustrated as a wolf, where the main character Jim is changed into a rabbit. This has, therefore, nothing to do with the \"New Treasure Island,\" Tezuka's masterpiece Manga.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

However, he miraculously regained his life. At the hospital where he was brought in, Kenichi will be in the same room as Jun Hayashi, an older kid who is suffering from heart disease and can only move in a wheelchair.\n\nStudents from class come visit Kenichi with his mother. He didn't have a lively face and found out that the class thinks he fell out of the window as an accident while cleaning it and told his mother that which she believes. \n\nJun has a brighter outlook on life and shows Kenichi his drive to live even though the world is so against him. They two grow closer together and vow to eat great ramen one day. The night before Jun's surgery they accomplish that ramen journey and on the way to the operating room, Jun yells at Kenichi \"if you commit suicide, give me your life. If you don't need it, please give it to me!\"\n\nEveryday Kenichi gets to eat good food, play good games, and do whatever he wants (even to go to school, he can even change schools too) which Jun never even has the opportunity to do because of his heart. Kenichi's will to live is reignited, because there are people out there will even less who would gladly trade their life for his bullied one.",

However, there was only one house without this talisman and without throwing the roasted soybeans. In this house, a girl and sick mother lived together. The girl kept vigil beside her mother\u2019s bed all days and did not have enough time and money to eat meal, not to mention throwing roasted soybeans. Realizing the predicament they were in, Onita found meal from somewhere. Disguising as a man, he offered the meal he got to the girl, saying that he made too much for Setsubun. The meals he offered were sekihan and green bean dish. He then leaves to find a new place to live, leaving only his hat behind.",
