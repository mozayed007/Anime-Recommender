In order to achieve this end, he is given the Dango-ken, which is a sword with Japanese Dumplings skewered onto it. Whenever Zenmai Zamurai sees people doing injustice or generally being out of control, he uses his sword to shoot the dumplings into their mouths. When the dumplings are eaten, the people suddenly become happy and realize the error of their ways. He helps out the people of his village in many ways, big and small. Whenever he has done well, a rainbow comes out of the sky to wind up his key.\n\n-Wikipedia",

However, many Promin who have turned into bugs known as \"Bugmin\" are responsible for many of the world's real-life bugs. Left alone, they may eventually turn into a big problem. The boy Yuuto encounters the space dog Wanda, and the pair use a camera-like device and key items to capture Bugmin. Promin themselves are able to do things like \"accelerate objects,\" \"spew fire,\" or \"create objects,\" through an ability known as \"Kamiwaza\" (miracle), and are able to fend off Bugmin with it. At first, the Bugmin only cause small, bothersome things, but it will soon elevate into a global scale threat. Can one boy and one dog save the world?\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Punch is a bear who is literally strong-headed: his head is as hard as a rock, and nothing can knock him down. Boom the weasel is an expert shot, using not a gun, but a slingshot. Touch the mouse takes advantage of her smallness in order to get into small holes and sneaking into things without the villains knowing. \n\nGari-Gari is a mad scientist wolf who wants to build a mansion over the junkyard, constantly thinking up evil plans to get the money needed to buy the property, whether it\u2019s creating a machine that creates counterfeit 10 yen (about 10 cents in US money) or stealing priceless paintings and selling it to a high bidder. He is an inventor, creating things that can aid him into doing his deed. If Gari-Gari buys the junkyard, this of course means that the three heroes will have no place to stay, so they constantly thwart his schemes. Gari-Gari has two henchmen working for him: Black and Nyu. Black is a gangster cat who welds a gun, often shooting at Punch and the gang with it. Nyu is a simple-minded pig who has big strength. \n\n(Source: Cartoon Research)\n\n*Based on Hustle Punch by Mori Yasuji, serialized in Manga O.",

In order to cover expenses, he decides to let out the second floor of their apartment to earn additional rental income. One day, an obstinate-looking eldery dog, accompanied by a younger boy-dog, came knocking on their doors. The eldery dog addresses himself as Norayama Kuroyoshi and introduces his grandson as Norakuro. The former wants to open a detective agency and intends to rent the unit for their office. He will be the president of the investigative bureau while Norakuro-kun will be the director. He will also recruit one of the Kinoshita's sons, Keita-kun, as his employee and their advisor will be the girl-next-door, a high school student by the name of Rika Sawaguchi. On the third day since the official opening of the office, the telephone rang, a signal of a new case. \n\n(Source: ANN) ",

Only the young Yun Feixue is left in the Yun family\u2019s bloodline, and Yun Feixue is also mysterious. Parasitized by power, that power unexpectedly merged with Yun Feixue, and transformed into a phantom exactly like him. The phantom was parasitized in Yun Feixue's consciousness, and he was always ready to accumulate power and devour his soul. Yun Feixue, who had just suppressed the phantom in his body, received the sad news of his father and brother's tragic death. He was idle in the dark, but behind his back he gathered an organization called \"Shadow\" to secretly investigate the mystery of the year.\n\n(Source: Narul Donghua)",

These disasters will always come true after Marty experiences the prophetic visions, but he is unable to predict accurately when and where they will occur.\nWhen the government learns about this, a unit is sent to protect Marty, and World Peacekeepers, abbreviated as WPK, is established to fight against the Black Armors. In order to defeat the Black Armors, the government grants permission for World Peacekeepers to use Ammobots \u2013 mechanical armors which have been developed over many years.\n\nAfter several battles with the Black Armors, the World Peacekeepers realizes that they are actually linked to the unusual natural disasters and discovers that they originate from a small planet called Mirzam, which is outside the solar system.\n\nTheir real intention is to seize the abundant ecological resources on Earth and when these resources are seized, the ecosystem will lose its balance, thus leading to natural disasters.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",

Set on the North Shannxi Loess Plateau, the story tells about two boys trying to sell a pig, the only valuable property of the poor family, for food. However, things go wrong. The film was artistically designed to present the spectacular and broad scenery of the Loess Plateau as well as the simple life of the people.\n\nThis is a black humor about the difficult years in the northwest of China in 1970s.\n\n(Source: Youtube, edited)",

On her way from from school Tama Elder tells her that she and her Cocotama friends won a trip to the Cocotama World. Here they see how full fledged Cocotama gods work. Elder Tama asks for Kokoro's help in helping humans realize the value of their items instead of so easily tossing them away. But Tepple had snuck into the Cocotama world with the others and taken a key acorn which unlocks the Happy Tree that contains Happy Stars, the source of magic for their world. Elder Tama found out it was missing and the Cocotama gang try to track it down. He says that mushrooms are appearing on tossed away items that as they are born from the feelings of sadness, and they emit a negative energy that effects both humans and Cocotama. Cocotama can get rid of them but not without the acorn and not at the speed humans are currently discarding items at.\n\nTepple uses the acorn to take a Happy Star but inadvertently causes a rift of darkness and an infestation of mushrooms in Cocotama World. And Happy Stars begin spilling out into the human world draining all magic out. Kokoro and the Cocotama must heal Tepple's heart before the darkness consumes the human world.",

The central character, Shinji, is a boy who loves to draw. In elementary school, he encounters Masaru, a strange young boy who also loves drawing, but who draws only masked wrestlers. The two become friends. \n\nAs they progress through their elementary school grades, however, they gradually grow apart. Years later, Shinji still remains true to his dream of becoming a manga artist, and goes on to study art at the university. When his work is selected for a Best Young Artist Award, he decides to move to Tokyo and soon gets his first breakthrough. What awaits him there, though, is something completely different from the manga artist\u2019s life that he had imagined. One day, for the first time in years, the 30-year-old Shinji comes across some work of his old friend Masaru, who has remained true to his drawing style. \n\nThe story is a mockumentary (\"mock documentary\"), and the narration is interspersed with monologues by Shinji's mother. As the central character grows, the animation style evolves from juvenile drawings doodled on random pieces of paper to sketches drawn on specialized manga paper, thus visualizing the flow of time.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival)",

The reason is very clear: the setting of the story is the exhausted earth. There couldn't be a more instructive setting for a power company that uses enormous amounts of the earth's resources. Additionally, a girl robot discovered by the main character can store sunlight and convert it into energy; in other words, the robot does not require a power-generating company. In addition to this, the robot destroys herself to protect the established solar power generation system in space. \n\nThe unsuccessful outcome of the competition for Tezuka Osamu was only natural, and it is clear that he created this piece, as it was intentionally, as he managed everything from the original story to the screenplay, animation, narration, etc., all the while knowing that the competition was sponsored by a power company. \n\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)",

However, the series never materialized and only this episode was actually aired. The story follows Stevenson's \"Treasure Island,\" featuring characters in the form of animals. For example, the pirate Silver is illustrated as a wolf, where the main character Jim is changed into a rabbit. This has, therefore, nothing to do with the \"New Treasure Island,\" Tezuka's masterpiece Manga.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

One of them scored the winning goal, one was the goal keeper who barely missed the ball, and the others were two groups of two who were rooting for their respective sides. Suddenly, when they defeat a boss, a strange thing pops up in front of them, and they're sucked into the game world! Tomoru (scorer), Mio, and Dai end up together with Professor Galileo, who tells them that he's the one that created this game that they`ve appeared in, called Eureka, but he inadvertently got sucked into it as well. In order to get back to their world, they need to clear missions that pop up in certain areas of the world. So when a mission appears, Tomoru and the gang make the professor take them along.\n\nWhen they get to area C-1, they find that not only do they have a mission, but they have a rival group! The rival professor has brought their rivals from the soccer game, Yukio, Suzuka, and Kouta, with him! Their mission, of course, is a scientific one. First the computer explains how lightning is formed, and then they have to figure out a way to stop the lightning to clear the mission! Tomoru and company manage to get it done, and get a Eureka Stone, letting them get back to their world! Except... the gateway back actually needs ten Eureka Stones total before it will open! Sounds like there's a lot of science to be learned and missions to be cleared before they can go home.\n\n(Source: Jascii.net)",

However, years pass and a pangolin accidentally drills through the mountains and releases the demons.\n\nAn old man is hiking on the mountains nearby and falls next to a cave where the pangolin escapes from. The pangolin explains the situation and tells the old man the legend of seven calabashes that can save their land from being destroyed. The old man knows what he must do and obtains the legendary calabash plant seed in order to defeat the demons.\n\nAs each calabash matures, it transforms into a child with unique powers.  With a combined effort, these seven calabash brothers set on a mission to defeat the demons in a 13 episode-long adventure.\n\nIn a sequel series, it is later revealed that there was a third demon, specifically the sister to the snake spirit, that had been in hiding underground during the whole battle. The only survivor from the defeat of the two demons, a humanoid toad with a blinded eye, comes and desperately reports the news. Naturally, the demon is enraged and attacks the mountain that contains the seven brothers in order to avenge its siblings' deaths.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

This series uses the unconventional technique of blending actual documentary footage with CG animation to get a close-up look into the front lines and what lies behind the scenes of Asian business.\n\nOur cartoon host is Shima Kosaku, a character from a popular Japanese business manga. He delves into the heart of the Asian economic market representing 4 billion people, to visit entrepreneurs who have survived turbulent times. Thai business magnate, Dhanin Chearavanont (Chairman of CP Group), and innovative Taiwanese semiconductor entrepreneur, Morris Chang (Chairman of TSMC), are among the many movers and shakers to be featured. Don't miss this opportunity to glimpse the dramatic lives of these media-shy business titans.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",

During her journey on the north wind, she meets Tsubasa, a tree boy who can speak. The Earth has become totally ruined to the extent that no creature can live there, because humans have drained it of all resources and destroyed the environment. Unico and Tsubasa go on a journey to find a way to make the Earth inhabitable again. They finally meet the Sphinx and the \"time fairy\" at the end of their hard journey. They decide to go back to the past and prevent humans from taking the wrong path. However, they can stay in the past for only five minutes. Will they be able to alter the future of the Earth in such short time? Their adventures to restore the Earth begin...\n\n(Source: Official page)",

        "synopsis": "\"47 Prefecture Dogs\" is a short flash animation from a voice over variety TV program in Japan called \"SAY! YOU! SAY! ME!\" The animation takes Japan's 47 prefectures\u2014or more specifically, the local delicacies or famous landmarks from each of the regions\u2014and gives them a canine makeover. For example, the \"Fukuoka-ken\" (Fukuoka dog),\u2014Fukuoka of course being home to asianbeat HQ\u2014uses the delicacy \"mentaiko\" (spicy pollack roe) as the motif for its canine characterization.\n\nEach of the characters are played by voice actors that hail from each of the individual prefectures, \"Fukuoka-ken\" being voiced by Fukuoka's Kana Asumi.\n\nAnother feature of this anime is the use of regional dialect. All the dogs speak in the dialect of their individual prefectures. So for the Fukuoka dog you hear a lot of \"~to\" and \"~to yo\" at the end of sentences; for the Aichi dog it's \"~dagane,\" and for Ehime, \"~zonamoshi,\" etc.\n\n(Source: AsianBeat.com, edited)",

In the sky above their house a giant angel is flying past. A forest has grown on the angel's back. In the forest three creatures sit around a table and playing cards. The cards are laid out and feature different images: three cards depicting babies jump down a hole in the middle of the table and begin a journey through the body of the angel. They stop in a cave where a creature plays the harp for them and turns the cards into tears. The tears fly through the air out of the angel's eyes and one of them reaches the woman's womb. In the next scene she is seen sitting at home, with her cat, contentedly stroking her own pregnant belly. The next scene is an exterior: a field with a lone tree growing on it. The man is dancing and walking towards the tree: behind the tree he finds his partner, the woman, holding a baby. They all smile at each other.\n\n\n(Source: Tommaso Corvi-Mora)",

Unfortunately, negative karma cannot simply be destroyed, it must be atoned for. However the leader of the powerful mystic Buddhist Fuze Clan plans to stop the destruction of the negative karma which will end up creating the nine-headed Naaga and destroy the world if not the whole universe. To help in stopping the creation of the Naaga, the clan summons a Shinto god known as Susano, the Warrior God of Destruction. The powerful, arrogant, and homicidal god faces challenges. These include the Empire and the clan leader's own daughter, the bratty sorceress Seska, who is possessed by the power of the negative Karma and a powerful magic formula.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
