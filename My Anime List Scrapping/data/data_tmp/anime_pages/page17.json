        "synopsis": "The \"Bobby\" referred to in the title is actually 17-year-old Akihiko Nomura, an underachieving high school kid with a deep love for motorcycles. His grades are failing, and his father \u2013 traditional and strict (but who must have also at some point gave in and allowed him to have a motorcycle) \u2013 is trying everything he can think of to get the kid to apply for college. His mother is so silent, she might as well not even exist. Really, his support system lies entirely in his twinkle-toed little sister, who's nosy but cheers him on in her own way.\n\nBobby really does little else but work on his bike. He cleans his bike. He tunes up his bike. He rides his bike. One would call him a motorcycle otaku. His most recent achievement seems to have been getting photos of himself on a road trip printed in a motorcyclist hobby magazine. This leads to an unexpected result: a girl his age, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A long, rambling letter, but dreamily romantic just the same. Bobby admits to his sister that he's never gotten a letter from a girl before. He writes back, \"I got your letter. I'm happy 'cause it was from a girl.\"\n\nBobby is not a well-rounded kid. He barely speaks \u2013 even to his own family \u2013 and the \"letters\" he writes back to the mystery girl usually consist of a single sentence or so. His obsession is all-consuming, to the point where he happily quits school to work at a biker bar. Of course, his father, at a loss, kicks him out of the house. Staying with a friend, he's delighted when his female pen pal says she'll call him. On that day, his boss at the bar decides to take him to a motocross track. But that's a day that wouldn't end in a way that anybody would expect.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)",

They are dealing with the sometimes joyous, but often horrific realities of everyday life. Set in modern day Japan, this compilation of short stories explores the lives of people from all walks of life. The animation used here is subtle, with realistic renderings that fully express the range of emotions experienced by the film`s characters. HUMAN CROSSING taps into the dramatic potential of reality, focusing on the isolated, sometimes lonely nature of urban life. Ultimately, however, the film suggests that perhaps there is an inter-connectedness between people that binds even the most disparate strangers together.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Still, two more episodes about the same story were produced a bit later, this time under the main title \"Rockman\" (unlike Episode 2, where he's called Mega Man, even in the japanese dub).\n\nIt's unknown if these 3 Episodes ever saw an official release, until 2002, when Capcom of Japan decided to finally (re)release them on DVD for Rockman's 15th Anniversary (all featuring a Japanese and English dub, but no subs).\n\nIt's unknown if there are any more secret animated works of the original Rockman game-series.\"\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

However, Yuki gets the mind shaken as Kenji and Hiyori become intimate, and the pain in her mind in the childhood is recalled. \n\nAt the childhood, Yuki was going to pass the light blue toy ring which Kenji had had to Hiyori in exchange for Hiyori's yoyo.

Disowned by his father when he is 18, 16 years full of changes and errantry begin for him. At the age of 34 he inherits great wealth after his father dies and forgives his son.\n\nWhen Yunosuke is 57, one of his tailors named Juzo comes to see him before setting out for Edo. Juzo has unwisely made a bet with a rich merchant that he will sleep with Komurasaki, the most renowned courtesan in Edo, at the first meeting. If he succeeds he will win a villa, but if he loses he will lose his manhood. Yunosuke is astounded as he knows how hard the high rank courtesans are to get. The best courtesans, tayu, as well as being beautiful, were highly cultured, being educated in poetry, calligraphy, painting, tea ceremony and other arts. They would sleep with a client only on the third night, the other two nights being taken up with greetings and other social niceties. Humble men, to whom they were 'untouchable' looked up to them with adoration and respect.\n\nIndignant, Yunosuke takes Juzo to Edo and enables him to meet Komurasaki. Juzo is a laughing-stock at the tea-house because of his nervousness, and soon becomes drunk. He clumsily spills wine over the courtesan's kimono. Unperturbed, she goes out and returns wearing a fresh, identical garment.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Ikaruga Natsuki, a boy who lost his mother and his leg in an accident some years earlier, returns disillusioned from a harsh life in the big city to find his old countryside home half-swallowed by the sea. Left without a family, all he has to his name is the ship and submarine left to him by his oceanologist grandmother, and her debts.\n\nHis only hope to restore the dreams for the future that he has lost is to take up an opportunity presented to him by the suspicious debt collector Catherine. They set sail to search the sunken ruins of his grandmother's laboratory in order to find a treasure rumor says she left there. But what they find is not riches or jewels; it is a strange girl lying asleep in a coffin at the bottom of the sea. Atri.\n\nAtri is a robot, but her appearance and her wealth of emotions would fool anyone into thinking she's a living, breathing human being. In gratitude for being salvaged, she makes a declaration to Natsuki: \"I want to fulfill my master's final order. Until I do, I'll be your leg!\"\n\nIn a little town slowly being enveloped by the ocean, an unforgettable summer is about to begin for this boy and this mysterious robot girl... \n\n(Source: Aniplex.EXE, edited)",

To have the Chojin replaced.\n\nAs Takeaki is injured in the approaching flight, Nagumo donates some of his blood to save his life, thus infusing Takeaki with the powers of the overfiend. And the results might be too much for Tokyo, perhaps even the overfiend himself, to bear.\n\n(Source: themanime.org)",

The car of choice for these strangers in a new world? The Prius, particularly the Prius Liftback and Prius C hatchback. These two hybrids seem to be as much a part of this series as the two main characters are. A Lexus LFA (likely the ride of the antagonist) and the Toyota Camry hybrid also have a role to play.\n\nEach anime short in the campaign will be three to four minutes long and will be posted on Toyota's specially-dedicated website.\n\n(Source: Auto Tribute)",

They were helpless to fight against them and resigned themselves to imminent death. At that time, an ultimate weapon which could create items out of imagination was discovered in a expansive cave under Japan, along with its young master Ryuusei who was in cryostasis. The indiscriminate alien attacks awoke him and he led the humans to a decisive victory.\n\nOne year later, while the areas which had been destroyed by the aliens were still being rebuilt, Ryuusei was appointed as the commander of the newly-formed Defence Force of Earth, which was created to fight against space invaders. However, he was the only person who could use the \u2018imagination embodiment device\u2019. If something was to happen to him, then calamity would befall the world. So the Defence Force of Earth decided to recruit girls with potential to fight alongside him. Even though they hesitated at first, they each had their own reasons to join Ryuusei. Thus, the special force \u2018Blade Briders\u2019 was formed, to protect the Earth against the aliens who have returned.\n\n(Source: Hau~ Omochikaeri!)",

GASP is a upcoming band known for its violence, struggling to be noticed against the popularity of hotshot Aikawa, who's #1 on the charts and beloved by his fans. The Yaon Hibiya concert represents GASP's mainstream debut to break out of the small-time club scene, which is threatened by the schemes of Aikawa's manager, Ms. Kato of Koyama Productions. Kato wants To-Y to leave that \"bunch of hoodlums,\" and sing independently for a major label. \n\nAdding to the confusion is an unexplained character who manifests feline traits, named Niya. Niya presents herself as \"To-Y's aijin\" (\"Niya, To-Y no aijin da yo!\") to the consternation of Koishikawa Hiderou, who has interest in To-Y. Koishikawa, also known as \"Sonoko-chan,\" is typed as a \"okama\" by Niya. A running motif is GASP, it's fans, and associates regarded as unusual by the mainstream public, as exemplified by their musical taste, dress, and Classic Coke-drinking, which only contributes to more difficulty in their struggle to be accepted.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

As World War II progresses, Chitose begins to realize that her family will not be able to escape the effects of the conflict. From the simple disappointment of not being able to get the type of backpack she wants for school, to her father's recruitment as a soldier, the war begins to impact her life in a very real manner. But the end of the war does not mean the end of hardship for her. The Koreans, fed up with years of Japanese rule and persecution, have joined forces with a Chinese-backed communist government and are systematically making life a living horror for the Japanese left in North Korea. Fearing reprisal since he was a Japanese veteran, Chitose's father risks everything to get his family out of the north and to the US-occupied area south of the 38th parallel.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The story is actually based upon real people - the doctor, Ryo-an, was Tezuka's great grandfather.\n\nDuring the Second Year of Ansei (1855) in Edo's Koishigawa are two young men, Manjiro Ibutani and Ryoan Tezuka. Ibutani is a low-ranking samurai who is a gifted swordsman and has a straightforward and strong sense of justice. Tezuka has a more carefree attitude. He has an eye for the ladies, but he is passionate about becoming a doctor. The two opposite characters come of age during the backdrop of the turbulent end of the Tokugawa Period (1600-1868 CE).\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo) ",

These equipments then allowed them to be young Permans who try to maintain peace and help the people who are in need.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

One day, Kasuga Nozomi encounters a strange boy at her high school, who sends her across time and space to Kyou, a place in another world that bears a strong resemblance to Kyoto towards the end of the Heian period. There, the Minamoto clan (\"Genji\"), led by Minamoto no Yoritomo, is at war with the Taira clan (\"Heike\"), led by Taira no Kiyomori. The Heike hope to defeat the Genji by releasing vengeful spirits to disturb the earth`s natural flow of energy and to terrorize the land. The boy is revealed to be the human form of Hakuryuu, the White Dragon God that protects Kyou, who is weakened by the presence of the vengeful spirits. As the Hakuryuu no Miko (Priestess of the White Dragon God), Nozomi allies herself with the Genji because Hakuryuu cannot send her home until his power is restored...\n\n(Source: AniDB) ",

In particular, Kenshirou is a convenience store worker, Raoh works at a factory, and wracked by illness, Toki is looking for work. The legend of the Fighting NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) North Star begins in the modern day.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)\n\n\nNote: Short stories adapting Hokuto no Ken: Ichigo Aji manga are included at the end of each episode.\n\nServing as a spinoff gag manga of the original Hokuto no Ken series, the story is a parody of Fist of the North Star by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara. It consists of page-long gags centered mainly on Souther, both within his final battle with Kenshiro and inserting himself into other parts of the series where he doesn't belong. One recurring gag involves the kid with a turban repeatedly stabbing Souther in the leg every time he climbs the pyramid's staircase, and another involves Rei suddenly transforming into Souther in his iconic moments. \n\n(Source: Hokuto no Ken Wikia)",

It is not known where or when he was born, and if asked, Locke will say he does not remember. It is entirely possible this is true. However, when asked by Cornelia Prim in \"Millennium of the Witch\" which star he was from, Locke replied \"Toa.\"\n\nHe has appeared at various times throughout the history of the galaxy, either as a direct influence, an indirect influence, or a simple observer. Using his esper abilities, Locke can learn and do most things more quickly than a normal human. His power also allows him to remain eternally young, or even turn himself into a child again to be adopted by kind-hearted families. It is speculated he remains youthful as an excuse not to take responsibility for whatever cause he is approached for, since no one expects youths to have such responsibilities.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The truth is, however, that the train incident was all a cunning trap plotted by Shun. Back home, Miyu regrets having her first kiss stolen. Then, Kou, her childhood friend, appears and, due to Miyu losing her key, takes her to his home. There, Miyu confess her first kiss was stolen. However, Kou tells her they have already kissed, so it was not her first kiss.... That night, Kou takes Miyu's virginity.\n\nThe next day at school, Shun apologizes and invites her home. Miyu accepts, not knowing is a trap. There, Shun drugs her and trains her as sex slave. She resists it at first, but after that day, when she remembers that, she starts masturbating. Did she actually like it, and does she want more? What about Kou?",

When she arrives home from school, Izuru often goes directly to her brother's side and indulges in him. Unlike her proactive sister, Kokone merely watches them from the side while drowning in jealousy. All she can do is pleasure herself to the sound of their salacious acts.\n\nOne day, however, Kokone's frustration bubbles up, leading her to lash out at her sister and brother. Now, Izuru takes it upon herself to console Kokone, trying to convince her to be more honest about her feelings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Until then, I haven't noticed, what has stayed unchanged in my daily life, the familiar scenes that have always been there, the warmth of the person whom I haven't noticed that I love her. \n\nThey have existed to bind me in this world in order not to let me leave. \n\nIt is the moment when I begin look for the bind and the significant person, for the first time. The time goes, and the sun gradually begins to shine the season. I wonder where I will be, and who will grip my hand. ",

However, the battle he gets is one he did not anticipate; the two are teleported to a mysterious arena in the sky\u2014the Isekai World\u2014where Spirits from the game become real.\n\nFeeling that his dream is finally within arm's reach, Bashin dives headfirst into the Isekai World, encountering other card battlers with extraordinary pendants.

In the old days they'd go off into the country and hack each other up with swords, but these days, what with school, that isn't very practical.\n\nSo some of them do something very un-Japanese. They strap on a big bike, roar around annoying people, and pound anyone they consider dishonorable.\n\nNow meet Eguchi Yousuke, leader of a high-school Biker gang AND the school's handicrafts club. Which means he divides his time between fistfights and fancy needlework.\n\nAnd if you think he's weird, wait until you meet the rest of his gang...\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Kim Woon Ki's kooky mystery thriller \"Wanted\" is set in a peaceful village suddenly disrupted by heavy rainfall and the appearance of a strange old woman named Selma. Yeon Sang Ho's 3-D animation \"Love is Protein\" is an inventive black comedy about three poor roommates who break their piggy banks to order fried chicken - only to discover their prospective meal is the son of a weeping chicken. Jang Hyung Yoon's surreal \"A Coffee Vending Machine and Its Sword\" follows a swordsman who reincarnates as a coffee vending machine and falls in love at first sight with the maintenance girl.\n\n(Source: YesAsia)",
