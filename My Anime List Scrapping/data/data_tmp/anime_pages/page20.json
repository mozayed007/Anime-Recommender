Lacking an established military or specialized weapons of warfare, the Omni rebellion seemed doomed to failure. However, by adapting the robotic Power Loaders used for unloading spaceships into man-like battle tanks, the Rebel forces instead introduced a whole new era of mechanized combat. Now, the future of the planet Omni rests upon a handful of young female pilots who serve in the special Detachment of Limited Line Service. Their code name: The Power Dolls!\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

With the head of the Egobossler family, Count Egobossler (and his two subordinates Mechandol and Kempler), Z is bent on destroying the Earth, and the Science Ninja Team, once more.\n\nIn the wake of Anderson's death, Dr.Nambu has become the new head of the ISO, while the team is now confined to the Gallatown (aka \"G-Town\") underwater base. Engineer Kamo is introduced, and after the New GodPhoenix is destroyed early on, the team receives the new Gatchaspartan as their mecha. The Gatchaspartan has a special mode as well, called Hypershoot, that can only be utilized by Ken (with his new \"Gatchafencer\" sword).\n\nAs the series progresses, it is learned that the radiation exposure from constant use of the Hypershoot is slowly killing Ken, and that continued use would mean death. Meanwhile, Z plans to destroy the earth with an antimatter asteroid, codenamed \"Poison Apple\".\n",

Vowing to return when he is older, Yuuki confesses that he would like them to go out when that happens. Unsure if their feelings for each other will remain the same when they next meet, Ann runs off in a panic, only to encounter a portal at the entryway of the castle. Stepping through it, she finds herself 50 years in the future.\n\nIn her confusion, An is approached by a boy named Kibou and his friendly robot, Butler-kun. As luck would have it, Kibou's grandmother instructed him to lend a hand to any troubled girls he encounters at the park, so he offers to be her chaperone. As the three explore the city, An notices that despite how much Okagi has changed, the old charm never evaporated from the nostalgic townscape.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It is the most celebrated event on a united Earth, and Yuri, now the President of Earth, has encouraged people to join the ranks of Excellent Idols. Unfortunately for Mimu, she can never seem to make it to her audition on time, as misadventure after misadventure lands her in situations (usually involving undergarment exposure, I might add) that she escapes with the help of the current Excellent Idols, whom she befriends. Just as she makes her place on the stage and begins her audition, though, an unknown group of aliens kidnaps her and the Excellent Idols. It is only the beginning of a wild interdimensional goose-chase that places Mimu in the position to save the world, if only she can believe in herself.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

Their finest assassin is a man named Hayate Kanuma, whose father leads the Shinogara. \n\nHayate, however, knows that the secret society's control over Japan is wrong. Sacrificing his own safety, Hayate kills his father. Now he's on the run, safe almost nowhere from his vengeful former comrades except perhaps for the one hiding place he decides upon: his sister. After possibly being fatally wounded, Hayate is able to transfer his soul into his sister's body, temporarily sharing it with her. His sister, Shiori, can awaken Hayate and call upon his ninja abilities when the Shinogara are close at hand but each time she does so, a little more of her true self is lost. This arrangement can't possibly go on forever, so how will Hayate finally defeat the Shinogara? \n\n(Source: Cammila Albertson)",

But he hasn't got well though a few weeks have passed. I have now a concern about myself. Yes, it's about sex.... It's impossible to ask for sex to my husband. I can't masturbate myself at home because there are my husband and daughter. I can't talk to anyone about it.... I recently feel sexually excited when Mr. Noyama comes to my house. Is this because I'm not sexually satisfied or I suffer from some kind of illness? Oh, Mr. Noyama comes again....\n\n(Source: Eroge Shop)",

When Michael fell asleep that same night, he was awakened by a dainty Flower Fairy named Florence, who would take him on an enchanted journey to a land where flowers came alive, treble notes were mischievous, and adventure beckoned. There, he would soon come to realize that his love of flowers and desire to become a great musician could go hand-in-hand and help him to become focused in life and discover himself. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia) ",

Because of this, she had felt self-conscious about herself... especially with men who were constantly leering at her. This only intensified when she was attacked by a rapist with a breast fetish. Although she escaped unharmed, this only made worse her insecurities. It was only because of the intervention of Dr. Chang that she was able to feel good about herself. Out of gratitude, Sara became Dr. Chang's protege in the method of psychic feedback, the method which was used to cure her of her insecurities.\n\nHowever, Dr. Sara's method of therapy is vastly different than what Dr. Chang had used. By swinging her huge breasts in a circle, she is able to induce a hypnotic trance in her patients, after which she is able to learn what is bothering the patient and offer the proper solution. There is a risk of using this: Sara is often vulnerable to the sexual appetites of her patients and she must maintain control of the situation\n\nSara is not alone, though. She is often accompanied by Tamine, a man who cannot seem to get a woman, no matter how he tries. But Tamine is devoted to Sara (mostly because of her huge breasts, which he is able to cop a feel whenever the chance arises), and aids her in helping others in need.",

Hamtaro can\u2019t forget about her, even when he\u2019s awake. One winter day, Laura talks to Hamtaro. She tells him that everyone in the family is going home to her father\u2019s hometown. When Hamtaro tells his friends about it, Maxwell pulls out a Ham-Ham source book. It\u2019s a book on old hamster history. \n\nAccording to the book, there is a \u201chomeland\u201d for hamsters called \u201cHamja Kingdom\u201d. When the Ham-Hams build a sand castle and recite a spell exactly the way it is written in the book, they are whooshed to the Kingdom. When at last the hamsters reach the bustling Hamja Kingdom of hamsters, the popular King Hamja, the Mini-Hams that they\u2019ve met before in Ham-Ham Land, and many jar spirits called the Mo-Hams appear. A parade begins merrily with singing and dancing! But, the bad magic cat \u201cSabakunya\u201d appears suddenly, riding the giant sheep monster \u201cMee Mee\u201d, and starts to trample the town. What a disaster! \n\nThe Ham-Hams flee underground. The Ham-Hams are told of the state of the Kingdom and find that Sabakunya has snatched the King\u2019s daughter, Princess Shera, and is pressing her into marriage on the Kingdom\u2019s Founding Day. Sabakunya is trying to take over the country. Something clicks in Hamtaro\u2019s mind. Princess Shera is without a doubt the princess who appeared in his dreams! Hamtaro wants very much to run to the castle where Sabakunya is, and so he and the Ham-Hams enter the castle. In the castle, they encounter danger after danger, and Hamtaro, pursued by Sabakunya\u2019s henchmen, is separated from others. ",

He's never owned a kappa before, so he relies heavily on a book he purchased on the subject of raising and training kappa. The books gives several good tips for bringing up a smart and well behaved kappa, and it all seems very simple. Unfortunately, putting these techniques into practice and actually making them work is not quite as easy as the book implies. Kaatan seems to understand things at first, but usually ends up either forgetting what he's learned, or isn't interested in learning in the first place. However, this particular young man has a lot of patience, and continues his possibly fruitless effort to raise Kaatan into a pet he can be proud of.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Child of Destruction tells us more of Riki's past, as we flash back to his childhood to learn the terrible fate of his mother and how he himself was taken away from his twin brother Nachi during a game of hide-and-seek, with Nachi's plaintive cry of \"Are you ready yet?\" haunting him through the years. Riki has a six-pointed star emblazoned on his hand, while Nachi has a swastika on his, the significance of which go unexplained. Riki finds himself in the town of Misaki, dotted with illegal nuclear power plants and run by a religious fanatic military organization called \"God's Judgment.\" He is taken prisoner and made to fight in gladiatorial matches in a sprawling arena. He finds his brother, whose special powers have given him the name of \"Savior,\" but his reunion with his resentful sibling turns sour rather quickly. Part 2 is much gorier than Part 1, with Riki smashing his fists into numerous soldier opponents with far less restraint.\n\n(Source: IMDb)",

The Eto Rangers themselves are anthropomorphic animals, each representing one of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals (and The Twelve Branches in Buddhism). In Japan they are known as the Eto animals. The Novel Worlds are stories created by the human imagination, such as old folk tales as well as newer books. These living worlds play out repeatedly, and are necessary for the good of humanity. Princess Aura rules Mugen, which is an island continent hanging over an ocean from the skybound Novel Pole. The Great God Goal gives her power, but she may never leave the small palace island area. Their nemesis is the forgotten Spirit of Cats, Nyanma (real name, Chocolat), who was excluded from the choice of 12 protectors by being disqualified from the race (in actual legend there are many versions of this story). She seeks her revenge by distorting Novel Worlds with Jarei Monsters.\n\nWhen a Jarei Monster goes to a Novel World they alter the story, turning it into a different version, sometimes a parody of itself. Bakumaru, the Spirit of Mice, must use the Genmakyou mirror to reveal (\"Jarei Shouran!\") the evil spirit once enough clues lead to its identity. Often the Eto Rangers must play out some of the story to find out who or what it is, sometimes even taking on the role of one of the characters in the tale. After defeating the creature, Kirinda is called when Bakumaru holds up his hand with one of Aura's 12 gems on it and calls out \"Daikourin Kirinda!\" Kirinda descends from a dimensional slit and purifies the evil spirit with a beam weapon, calling out \"Jouka!\" (Purification).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

They also awaken the evil Jashin Drago from the holy seal he was trapped in. 200 years ago, Drago was trapped in the seal by a holy warrior with the tattooed mark of the Liger. Assuming that the warrior is dead, Drago and Empress Zara are free to conquer the Earth using their army of biomechanical beasts. Even the Japan Self-Defense Forces are no match for the Dragonites' awesome power. One of the people fleeing is the protagonist, a milquetoast 16 year old boy named Ken Taiga. Unbeknownst to the Dragonites, Ken realizes that he is the descendant of the Liger warrior! In a burst of anger, Ken's Liger birthmark appears, and he rises his palm into the air, shouting the henshin command, \"LIGER!!!\", which then covers him in demonic long-haired biomechanical armor. Ken transforms into Jushin Liger to fight the evil forces of the Dragonite! \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Though he still carries his twin-bladed katana, Kumosuke spends his days smoking, drinking, and womanizing, rarely coming home before dawn. At home, however, wait his wife and two children, Shinnosuke and Ohana, who are constantly troubled by Kumosuke's antics.\n\nAs Shinnosuke grows older, he begins to understand the world around him. Troubled by his father's reputation, Shinnosuke attempts to live a life of honor, though finding what honor means in a turbulent era is difficult. As Shinnosuke navigates his relationship with his father, countless other warriors struggle to find their place in the ever-changing world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

The \"Good for You\" political party that rose to power without electoral consent has instituted a \"Chocolate Prohibition Law!\" All food and drink that involves chocolate, along with nearly every other enjoyable treat has been outlawed by the new administration.\n\nEnter Huntly and Smudger, two young boys who used to hang around Ms. Bubby's sweets store just to catch a glimpse of the lovely Louise. Since the new law was passed, the store, once a lively place, had become destitute. Louise tips off the boys to a fledgling business involving the distribution of bootlegged chocolate. As they make their way to the secret mine of chocolate ingredients, they come across a mysterious code.\n\nAfter successfully decoding the cipher, the boys enter the illegal dealer's headquarters. Inside, they are pleasantly surprised by the commencement of a Chocolate Party! Hunter and Smudger are blissfully reunited with the taste of chocolate again. But the party is abruptly cut short by the presence of the Chocolate Police. As people flee in all directions the boys' friend Div is captured by the officials!\n\nUnforgivable! All he wanted was a bite of chocolate! What is so wrong about that? Huntley, Smudger, and Louise decide to embark on their own chocolate bootlegging venture. With their combined talents, knowledge and passion, will they be able to reclaim the \"Fun and Beautiful\" world they once inhabited?!\n\n(Source: Eleven Arts)",

She is, in fact, \"ugly,\" and as such, knows that cute things and a fairy-tale romance are out of her reach. Yet this does not stop her from daydreaming every morning as she tends to the school's beautiful flower beds that contrast her appearance.\n\nOne day, a casual encounter puts Tabata in contact with her classmate, Yousuke Ueno, who is well known for being both handsome and extremely kind. Why would such a popular student associate with a background character like her? To Tabata, it is an unfathomable situation, but can Ueno show her that looks aren't everything?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As \"Extars,\" the Etiquette Club members fight to eliminate evil from the world, which means the bizarre schemes of Sayaka, the nasty, super-rich president of the rival Debutante Club, and her flunky, Todo. \n\nThe series was created to promote a line of robot toys from Tomy, and viewers who are willing to accept high school girls' quarrels escalating into battles involving satellite weaponry may enjoy these silly adventures.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

To their great surprise, the last photo they take depicts Japanese folk hero Momotaro pulling a cart laden with treasure.\n\nLater, Nobita's mom encounters a foreigner who shows the kids a small picture of a person dressed as samurai. The picture looks almost like a photo, and the person in the picture looks exactly like Momotaro. The foreigner has inherited this picture from his ancestors, and he has come to Japan in order to learn the truth about its origins.\n\nNobita begins to think that Momotaro might have been a real person. In order to solve the mystery, he travels to the past of Japan along with Doraemon, Shizuka, Takeshi and Suneo.\n\n(Source: animania.co.uk)",

Set in the '80s and '90s, an old umbrella and a railroad crossing the downtown in the film is the stuff that reminds us of our lost past, evoking a reminiscence in the audience of that which is vanished.\n\nIt is a way of evoking the real \"dreams\" that we have lost in this modern society where a rapid capitalization is progressing.\n\n(Source: Hancinema)",

The setting for this exciting, funny and intriguing series is the Kingdom of Fir antic, where two royal houses are locked in combat to determine who will become the future ruler of the Kingdom. To secure the throne, one of two must travel through the aeons of time to find the Firebird. Whoever brings it back to Fir antic will rule from the throne of this mysterious country. The story starts in the present.... Here, in the desolate office of the Ace Detective Agency, Detectives Paul Tuck and Tracy Headly are whiling away the time reading magazines, for want of something better to do. Suddenly, a girl appears before them. From her strange dress the pair can just deduce that the girl couldn't possibly be from their time. She begins to speak...\"You are quite right. I am from another era. In time, you two will be married, and I will be born from your bloodline many generations hence\". The girl's name is Princess Sara of the Kingdom of Fir antic. Paul and Tracy are amazed by the girl's telepathic powers, and even more amazed to be told that they are to be married. But there is more to come. Princess Sara is looking for the Firebird with the use of a Time Tunnel. Paul and Tracy decide that it is their duty to protect their descendent's future. They offer to help Sara on her quest for the Firebird, but Sara has no idea where it is to be found. The only clue she has is that Princess Miranda and her party have come to this time as well. Sara telepathically discovers the whereabouts of their time machine, and our heroes chase after Miranda, who possesses any and all information concerning the Firebird.... \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

One day, a puppet he is carving out of wood begins to speak even before he has finished shaping it. The old man names the puppet Pinocchio, and treats him as the son he never had. The puppet is dreadfully naughty and causes trouble for the old man, but his heart is in the right place and he earns Jeppet\u2019s love as though he were a human son. However, tragedy befalls the pair. Pinocchio is deceived by the wicked fox Dino and his sidekick, the cat Witch, while on his way to school. Pinocchio and his friend Gina the duck are sold to the master of a puppet show, with little hope of ever reuniting with kind old Jeppet. The naughty puppet eventually runs away in order to search for his surrogate father, and finds himself in the middle of adventure after adventure, matching wits with the crafty Dino and Witch. His efforts to stay out of mischief never seem to work, and misfortune always seeks out our wooden hero. If Pinocchio can only manage to stay out of trouble, his ultimate wish will be granted and his dream will become a reality. Delighting and entertaining, The Adventures of Pinocchio shows us that a pure heart and good intentions are rewarded, and that true love can indeed create miracles.\n\n(Source: Nipponanimation)\n\nNote that the character is actually called \"Piccolino\" in this adaptation.

On one such asteroid, Tortatis, lives 12-year-old Nanbu Ushiwaka - the only child ever to be born in space and survive.\n\nBut survival itself is no longer guaranteed - a military satellite triggers a disaster during a operation to capture Halley's Comet, and Ushiwaka and his fellow colonists must find a way to survive when both their country and their company abandon them. Can they escape before the nuclear reactor on the asteroid melts down? Or are they doomed to die as they lived, among the stars?\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Headstrong school bad boy Shingo Tamai and his friend Ohira are determined not to be bullied into joining Matsuki's team; instead they set up a squad of their own, and at first play just for fun and struggle to keep up with Matsuki's team. \n\nAs their skills progress, they play other teams and get stronger and craftier, until they face the crack Asakase high school squad and its star player Misugi Yan in the schools' final. In a tangle of subplots involving old rivalries and injuries, and a mixed-race player seeking his identity and his lost mother (who turns out to be in jail), Shingo develops his skills as a center forward and looks forward to playing a visiting Brazilian squad. He is seriously injured in a game, but his talent, which even the legendary Brazilian Pele recognizes, is equaled by his determination. With the help of a friend of his old rival Matsuki, he recovers to help the team to victory. \n\nDefinitely melodrama rather than a sports series proper, this is the first in the line of Japanese soccer soaps that stretches to Captain Tsubasa and beyond. Based on a manga by Ikki Kajiwara and Kosei Sonoda. \n\n(Source: The Anime Ecyclopedia)",

One morning, however, becomes anything but ordinary for the young salaryman.\n\nAfter Seki awakens to a naked woman lying beside him in his bed, he is even further shocked when she reveals her desire for them to be together. Even so, this does not explain her supernatural abilities, telekinesis being one of many. Rather than questioning her elusive nature, he immediately cuddles with her\u2014finding the woman to be his ideal type.\n\nOn his way home from work, a vision of his newfound love leads Seki to crash his motorcycle, giving rise to a police chase. Meanwhile, the woman awaits him at his apartment but grows restless, apparently unable to be apart from him. Arriving a moment too late, Seki watches her vanish without a trace, unaware if his unnamed soulmate will ever return. Little does he know that returning is something she indeed plans on doing.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But not everything is smooth-sailing for the new couple. Tong Li's most recent work is being panned by readers and critics, and Wen Zheng Magazine's recent decline in sales means that her serialization is in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Jiang Xiaobai, fondly remembering making music with his friends in high school, steps in as the backup bassist for a local band struggling to make their break. \n\nSecretly, Tong Li is frustrated both by her writer's block and by Jiang Xiaobai venturing out to chase his old dream. Things come to a head when, following the replacement of the head editor for Editorial Office No. 2, her novel is canceled. As she and Jiang Xiaobai grow estranged and as her family increasingly meddles in their already-strained relationship, Tong Li wanders into a welfare center for autistic people, where she meets a young non-verbal man whose piano playing deeply moves her. She begins to volunteer at the welfare center, not realizing that her and Jiang Xiaobai's worlds are much closer than she thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.\n\nThroughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
