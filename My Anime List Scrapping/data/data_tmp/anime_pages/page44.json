The two sides fought for hundreds of rounds, and the star cats and the 12 constellations were forced to the edge of the cliff, and the danger was reborn. At this time, I happened to meet an old scholar who was drying the famous painting \"A River at Qingming Festival\", which was soaked in the sun. The harmonious and prosperous atmosphere of the picture immediately increased the energy of Star Cat and his partners. The unique tricks they played were combined with the power of painting. Transfiguration into a super weapon, frustrated the Dark Lord and his party members, and finally the Dark Lord escaped alone. This contest made the Black Demon realize the powerful \"spiritual light\" contained in \"Shanghe River on Qingming Festival\", so he ordered the little black monsters to study \"Riverside on Qingming Festival\". It\u2019s a pity that the little black monster\u2019s mind has not evolved, and it is impossible to study the mystery. However, he mistakenly discovered that many famous paintings other than \"The River on the Qingming Festival\" contain a powerful \"spiritual light\", so he conspired to start with \"The River on the Qingming Festival\" Start, go back to ancient China to prevent the artist from creating ancient paintings. Fortunately, the star cat and the 12 constellations were discovered in time, in order to secretly protect the painter and the associated scenery...(translated from iqiyi)",

        "synopsis": "There was a tree stump at the corner of a farmer's field. A speeding rabbit broke its neck and died on it. Rabbits make for a great meal and sell well on the market so the farmer decided to give up farming and just wait for more rabbits to come hit the stump and die again. But he waited and waited and no new rabbits came. Leaving his crops to fail and himself rabbit-less. The song is supposed to teach the lesson of waiting in vain. It's okay to have an optimistic view on something but do not idly sit around waiting for it to happen because it might not. Similar to the Western adage \"don't count your chickens before they hatch.\"",

In Japan, this arrangement was given Japanese lyrics and introduced as \"Amaryllis\" on NHK's Minna no Uta series in 1968. The tune has since become well known as a French folk song there and its melody can be heard today as a chime signaling the hour over the PA systems of some schools and rural municipalities.\n\n(Source: alchetron.com)",

As the years went by, the personalities of the four masters and apprentices we know have changed. Tang Seng became a narcissistic eye-catcher, and Wu Kong became an arrogant man. Bajie's personality hasn't changed, but he has become fatter again, and speaks fluent Northeastern dialect. As for the sand monks, they are even more powerful, directly becoming a string (commonly known as \"cold\")... Such a group of people is already very lively, but in order to let the audience feel this unparalleled gluttonous feast, We also unkindly joined a ruthless character-Bru. He has a cold body, a cold mind, and everything cold... In fact, he has to be cold, because he is a robot, too hot and short-circuited. However, because of a tsunami, this robot was short-circuited and turned into a little madman, doing its madness along the way, showing its nerves. Hey... After these people got together, there were many tragedies and farce from the first day they set foot on the journey in search of gems... I don't know what will happen to them all the way down?(translated from douban)",

The fatter and fatter Bajie speaks fluent Northeastern dialect, but the color and heart remain the same; and the most change is the monk Sha He became a ruthless character who didn't hit the south wall without looking back. There is also a robot Blu in the middle, which is cold from the inside to the outside and from top to bottom, because it will short-circuit when heated. There was an earthquake and tsunami on the westbound road, and the flooded Bulguo really short-circuited and became a madman. A group of five people staged a series of hilarious jokes on the way to learn from the scriptures, which made the audience laugh...\n(translated from douban)",
