        "synopsis": "The story of Lesson XX has a sweet feel to it. It revolves around two boys, Shizuka and Sakura who are friends at a coed boarding school. One day, Shizuka happens to notice Sakura\u2019s sheer beauty when he dives in to take a hit from a baseball. After some mixed up thoughts of who Sakura likes, Shizuka tells him he wishes to kiss him as a joke. But Sakura doesn\u2019t care; he still insists that the two kiss under the starry sky. After this incident, Shizuka thinks it\u2019s best for the two to be away from each other, so as to sort out their thoughts and real feelings. A classic shounen ai/yaoi, incorporating love, misunderstanding, violence and somewhat angst with a sweet end to it. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

        "synopsis": "From prehistoric times to the distant future, Hi no Tori portrays how the legendary immortal bird Phoenix acts as a witness and chronicler for the history of mankind's endless struggle in search of power, justice, and freedom.\n\nThe Dawn\nSince time immemorial, people have sought out the legendary Phoenix for its blood, which is known to grant eternal life. Hearing about rumored Phoenix sightings in the Land of Fire, Himiko\u2014the cruel queen of Yamatai obsessed with immortality\u2014sends her army to conquer the nation and retrieve the creature. Young Nagi, his elder sister Hinaku, and her foreign husband Guzuri are the only survivors of the slaughter. But while Nagi is taken prisoner by the enemy, elsewhere, Hinaku has a shocking revelation. \n\nThe Resurrection\nIn a distant future where Earth has become uninhabitable, Leona undergoes surgery on a space station to recover from a deadly accident. However, while also suffering from amnesia, his brain is now half cybernetic and causes him to see people as formless scraps and robots as humans. Falling in love with Chihiro, a discarded robot, they escape together from the space station to prevent Chihiro from being destroyed. Yet as his lost memories gradually return, Leona will have to confront the painful truth about his past.\n\nThe Transformation\nYearning for independence, Sakon no Suke\u2014the only daughter of a tyrant ruler\u2014kills priestess Yao Bikuni, the sole person capable of curing her father's illness. Consequently, she and her faithful servant, Kahei, are unexpectedly confined to the temple grounds of Bikuni's sanctuary. While searching for a way out, Sakon no Suke assumes the priestess's position and uses a miraculous feather to heal all those reaching out for help.\n\nThe Sun\nAfter his faction loses the war, Prince Harima's head is replaced with a wolf's. An old medicine woman who recognizes his bloodline assists him and the wounded General Azumi-no-muraji Saruta in escaping to Wah Land. But their arrival at a small Wah village is met with unexpected trouble as Houben, a powerful Buddhist monk, wants Harima dead. With the aid of the Ku clan wolf gods that protect the village's surroundings, he survives the murder attempt. After tensions settle, Saruta uses his established reputation in Wah to persuade the villagers to welcome Harima into their community. Over a period of time, Harima becomes the village's respected leader under the name Inugami no Sukune. But while the young prince adapts to his new role, he must remain vigilant as new dangers soon arise and threaten his recently acquired tranquility. \n\nThe Future\nLife on Earth has gradually ceased to exist, with the survivors taking refuge in underground cities. To avoid human extinction, Doctor Saruta unsuccessfully tries to recreate life in his laboratory. However, the unexpected visit of Masato Yamanobe, his alien girlfriend Tamami, and his colleague Rock Holmes reveals a disturbing crisis: the computers that regulate the subterranean cities have initiated a nuclear war that will eliminate all of mankind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They promise each other not to be too close, not to be too opposing, and to simply keep a vague and comfortable distance, having learned important values about men and women relationships from their parents' previous ones.\n\nSaki, who has worked alone for the sake of her family, doesn't know how to properly rely on others, whereas Yuuta is unsure of how to truly treat her. Standing on fairly equal ground, these two gradually learn the comfort of living together.\n\nTheir relationship progresses from strangers to friends as the days pass. This is a story that may one day lead to love.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

His own life appalls him, but he has one escape \u2013 his online life. Gaming has become his everything, and he excels at it.\n\nAfter another long, lonely night of gaming, he wakes up \u2013 and is shocked to find that he has transformed into a woman. Or to be more precise, a woman who looks a lot like those he used to lust after online! Confused, he does not know where to turn \u2013 so looks for answers on the net. He encounters a young woman in a chat forum named Sae Mi, who offers him advice. He soon falls for her charms \u2013 which makes things complicated to say the least. And things get even more bizarre when he attempts to take revenge on Sang Woo, a school bully who turns out to be Sae Mi\u2019s older brother!\n\n(Source: Viki)",

The training regimen is tough, and punishment for slacking is harsh. Fortunately, Chiyoko is able to keep her extra-curricular studies secret, aided by the fact that no one else can see Gyubid.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo.com)",

A group of Samurai have banded together, and, with the development of new weapons and new technology, they have both the will and the hardware to stand up and fight. Ichimatsu is one of these fighters. By day, he works incognito at a local tavern, in the evenings he frequents the brothels, and by the dark of night, he doles out some big-time, gun-barrel justice. He is here to help. He is Samurai Gun. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

Filled with wondrous tales of a mysterious pyramid and entrusted with his grandfather's journal, a young boy called Hunter Steele sets out on an exploration. There, his destined meeting with the Oracle occurs, and he is transported into the Inner World as a Spider Rider.\n\nFinding himself lost and confused in the middle of a forest, Hunter crosses paths with a giant spider named Shadow. Although reluctant, Shadow agrees to fight by his side. He then meets Corona\u2014a skilled Spider Hunter and kind girl with a penchant for normal life. She shows him the ropes of being a Spider Rider, and educates him about the fate of the Inner World if the Insectors continue their tyrannical reign.\n\nThus begins the story of Hunter Steele, a heedless young boy on a quest to save the Inner World. But his task of retrieving the four Oracle Keys holding the Oracle's true power will lead him to an ultimate clash against Mantid, leader of the Insectors.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Fighting his way to Megalopolis station, he makes it onto the train just as it departs. This time, however, Tetsurou is met with several mysteries: Maetel is nowhere to be seen, an ominous \"Ghost Train\" has appeared, and the ultimate destination of the 999 is unknown. Amid all this, Tetsurou finds himself confronted by the mysterious black knight Faust and soon discovers the machine empire's darkest secret.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The sex was rougher than anything he'd ever seen.\n\nSeveral days later, the person who sent the DVD\nmade a request. \"I know who you are. I want an amateur with your sort of perverse interests to do some training.\"\nA drug was provided. It was a drug used to make the gathering video. Sayaka lived for it.

        "synopsis": "Subaru Sumeragi is the thirteenth head of his powerful onmyouji clan. Until the time comes when he must succeed his grandmother fully, Subaru is allowed to live in Tokyo with his fraternal twin Hokuto. While Subaru is kind and shy, Hokuto has exuberance to spare, and her favorite pastime is designing bold matching outfits for the two of them to wear. Her next favorite thing to do is try to set up Subaru with their veterinarian friend Seishirou Sakurazuka who, oddly enough, is always readily available to accompany the Sumeragis throughout the city.\n\nSubaru has to resolve a variety of spiritual conflicts in Tokyo: some are cases formally brought to him by clients, and others are matters in which he decides to involve himself. A selfless teenager, he empathizes with others to the point that their pain may as well be his own. This leaves him vulnerable in a city where nearly everyone makes decisions that only benefit themselves as individuals. Hokuto hopes that if Subaru develops feelings for Seishirou, their relationship will be the one thing that he never gives up for the sake of anyone else. However, is Seishirou the best candidate for her brother's love, or is he hiding sinister secrets?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, an Eto-musume (Zodiac girl) named Na-tan appears, to the puzzlement of the 12 signs, and to the unreserved delight of Nya-tan (whose spirits are always lifted by the pure, straightforward Na-tan).

Akira takes the deal, only to realize that this PC is not a 9821 version, but a 2198 version instead. It turns out that the PC2198 is an advanced bio-type computer that needs a nearly constant input of sperm to function!\n\nThe PC2198, named Mimi, now has to defend Akira from the evil Apple Nacintosh sisters who want to take over the entire Japanese PC market. Will the embarrassed Akira be able to supply Mimi with what she needs to win?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But their farm and Ichiro's host club job aren't raising money fast enough for their liking, leading them to resort to get-rich-quick schemes.\n\nTheir plans usually involve tracking down evil-doers and then stealing their ill-gotten gains. Yet, while they usually do put a stop to the villains, they always end the day no richer than before. However, neither these failures nor interference from the policewoman Yukika Karakuri can come between this trio and their dream!

What makes this works extraordinary is the artist's decision to use the transparency and visual bulk of 3D computer graphics only for the un-moving ocean and glaciers. The people, whale, and ships are all hand-drawn, and with this contrast, he invites the viewer into a different world. This is a poem written in animation, the creation of a true fantasy. This project was a considerable under taking, and the results are marvelous.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Afterwards, the two continued to work together, although they earned their nickname, \"the Dirty Pair\" because of all the collateral damage the two (unintentionally) cause in the completion of their cases. And even though the two now get along with one another, they continue to bicker and complain to each other.\n\nAlthough it is often said that these are younger versions of the original Lovely Angels Kei and Yuri, in truth this series is an alternate universe telling of Dirty Pair, set in the years 2248-49.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

This whimsical place, oddly lacking in food and running water but full of electrical sockets, is home to a petulant girl in a mask, named Wolf Queen and becomes their playground and refuge during school hours. Hidden within the walls, they're told there's a key that will grant one wish, as well as a set of clues to find it. But there's a catch: the key must be found by the end of the school year and they must leave the premises by five o'clock each day or else suffer a fatal end.\n\nAs time passes, a devastating truth emerges: only those brave enough to share their stories will be saved. And so they begin to unlock each other's stories: how a boy is showered with more gadgets than love; how another suffers a painful and unexplained rejection, and how a girl lives in fear of her predatory stepfather. As they struggle to abide by the rules of the game, a moving story unfolds, of seven characters trapped in a cycle of misunderstanding and loneliness, who are ultimately set free by the power of friendship, empathy, and sacrifice. \n\n(Source: Erewhon Books, edited)",

Of course, it would be more accurate to call her his maid/willing sex slave, since when she isn\u2019t cleaning or making food, he\u2019s showing her all the ways to be a true maid. How should a true maid act you ask? By being sexually subservient and promiscuous of course! She\u2019s not quite there yet though, and Yuusuke\u2019s on a mission to train her to be a true maid, ready and willing to please wherever and whenever he so desires!   \n\n(Source: Animetric)",

The students in the school which Akitoshi went to were frightened. One day, an unknown girl appeared in the school. However, all the students except Akitoshi thought they had known her. Feeling strange, he shadowed her in order to investigate her but he lost sight of her. At that moment, he heard the scream of a woman from the nearby material yard and went to the place where the scream came from. There he found the beautiful girl of the school, Mikage. Mikage was surrounded by monsters \"Yuragi\" (fluctuation), and she was hanged naked. Yuragi noticed Akitoshi and began to attack him. Then, the fighter, Ai, appeared and cut them down. \nAkitoshi stared at Ai. What was her true character, an enemy or an ally? \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

This power lies in the form of a magical, light-emanating compact which was given to the Miroku clan. Anyone who bathes in the compact's light will be held victim to the Shikima's perverted assaults.\n\nMiko Mido is the latest descendent in the line of Miroku and is trying to juggle her life as a high school student with her training in \"sexcraft\" ninjutsu. Her grandmother serves as the guardian of the Miroku's compact. But a planned assault by the Suzuka clan not only leaves Miko as the sole guardian of the bloodline, but also results in the compact being stolen by the Suzuka. Determined to finish off the last of the Miroku, the Suzuka turn the power of the Shikima against the inexperienced Miko, putting her in a fight for control of the destructive demons, as well as her own life.\n\nMiko's situation is made even more troubling when she accidentally exposes her sister, Miyu to the terrors of the Shikima, resulting in her being abducted and taken to the demons' dimension. The stakes could not be higher for Miko as she and her loyal sidekick Nin-Nin must save Miyu, defeat the Suzuka clan, and prevent the Shikima from unleashing their violent lust upon the world of humanity.",

It was an enormous box-shaped island built by the government and referred to as \"Tokyo Kingdom.\"\n\nThere was hope that it would become a second city center floating at sea, but it had failed to attract businesses.\n\nThe only way of getting to and from the island was through Honshu Island over the 10 kilometer Tokyo Kingdom bridge. Unfortunately, this narrow route was the means in which the inhabitants of hell found their way onto the island, luring anarchists, criminals, and even illegal immigrants there, transforming the streets of the sea bound city into a world-renowned haven for danger.\n\nHowever abandoned the streets were, order did exist in such a place despite it being a breeding place of crime.\n\nThere was a business district at the heart as well as one of Asia's greatest prostitute grottoes. Whether or not it was only the strong who survived, the viability of living there required one not to be careless in making friends with the strong.\n\n(Source: Dark Translations)",

Tired of the mundane fights that once provided the group with temporary adrenaline, Kenji looks for an alternative source by starting a band on a whim. Enlisting the rest of his gang, he picks up the bass, with Oota on the guitar and Asakura on the drums. Despite having no prior experience playing musical instruments, their first session far exceeds their expectations.\n\nOngaku is the raw depiction of three teenage boys from the moment they discover the beauty of making music to their first live performance that turns a simple cure for boredom into a fiery expression of passion.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

Takagi survived and the situation was settled, but in Sato's eyes, the image of the grim reaper that she had seen when Jinpei Matsuda, the man she had been in love with, had been killed in a series of bombings three years ago, overlapped with Takagi's.\n\nAt the same time, the perpetrator of the bombings escapes from prison. Rei Furuya/Toru Amuro, a member of the public safety police, is hunting down the man who killed his classmate, but a mysterious person in disguise suddenly appears and puts a collar bomb on him.\n\nConan visits the underground shelter where Amuro is hiding out to disarm the collar bomb, and hears about an incident three years ago when he and his now deceased classmates from the police academy encountered an unidentified virtual bomber named \"Plamya\" in Shibuya. As Conan and his team investigate, a disturbing shadow begins to loom over them.\n\n(Source: Detective Conan World)",

For this reason, Animaru has chosen the middle schoolers Urara, Inaho, and Hanabi as warriors. The girls, however, are much more focused on mocking the events happening around them and trying to earn money as idols.\n\nWhen the Ice Queen's familiars appear, they use the \"Ice Mirror\" to trick the girls into performing ridiculous skits. Will Urara, Inaho, and Hanabi ever step up and embrace their roles as magical girls, or will their antics prove too distracting to themselves?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as \"Friar Tuck,\" they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.\n\nTheir bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons\u2014in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.\n\nThe girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort\u2014Alwine's accomplice\u2014who sought to attain the Lancaster's wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron's troops, led by Gilbert\u2014a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle's dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success. Thanks to his noble heart and heed for danger, Robin became rapidly known as the protector of the poor and oppressed. Beloved and highly esteemed not only by the villagers, but also and especially by the sweet and beautiful Marian he was. The boy who never parted from his loyal, magical bow, endlessly engaged in dangerous and unthinkable missions.",

The main character, who is the student president of the high school, has another hidden persona. The persona as head of the \u201cGang Rape Club\u201d...\n\nA dark ceremony existed that had been handed down for thousands of years in the old town of Rinin; the name of the ceremony, in particular, in the oldest of records. That ceremony, enacted to protect the region from disease and crop failure as a curse from the region's guardian deity, Hime Iwanaga, occurs in the evenings between the new moon and full moon, in which a maiden is disguised as Konohanasakuyabime and gangraped to appease Hime Iwanaga's anger. In regards to the maiden, there must be an important man participating in the gang rape, in other words, that man must be related in blood to their wife or lover, mother or daughter, younger sister or older sister, and the like, and after the gang rape, if a pregnancy occurs, Hime Iwanaga's anger is abated, and a good harvest and safety upon the region will be promised. However, if a pregnancy does not occur for the sake of suppressing Hime Iwanaga's anger, the maiden is supposed to be covered with semen, and floated down the river alive, as a sacrifice.\n\nAnd now---After the Tashio era, the ceremony itself had vanished into the dark history, but had still continued on at Rinin High School; the cruel, improper traditions being inherited over into a secret society through actions carried out by the Gang Rape Club. For generations, the student president of the High School has served as the head of the Gang Rape Club, not allowing even one day to pass uneventfully, submerging numerous women to the dark, suffocating pleasure.",

A 20-year trip passes, and the traveler has only aged 1 year. It definitely has its advantages, but after you've been on a few trips, it sure gets very lonely.\n\nRight now, however, that's not the big issue. The year is 2264. The Syncam Corporation has sent the Saldes and its crew of 13 (and 1 cat) out into deep space to explore the potential of a newfound planet 20 years away. Soon after they awaken from their stasis, however, things are happening one after another. First, the crew learns that two of the crew are not who they claim to be. Then, one by one, crewmembers die suddenly. Then, the ship begins to turn against them. And as if it couldn't get any worse, they find another mess on their hands and it is ugly.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a simple exploratory mission has become a struggle for survival in the depths of space. 20 years from home, they're all alone and no one can hear them scream.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

VTubers featured in Virtual-san wa Miteiru include Hime Tanaka and Hina Suzuki, who together make the rhythmic music duo HimeHina; Siro, the cyber girl, who definitely, certainly, positively has never murdered anyone; the lazy, FPS-loving Hinata Nekomiya; the upbeat Akari Mirai who sexually harasses her juniors; and the lightweight Mito Tsukino, who has a serious superiority complex.\n\nIn every episode these VTubers perform nonsense together in skits filled with slapstick, puns and fourth-wall-breaks. From the parody space adventure \"Virtual Wars\" to the nameless skit about bouncing gorillas, these absurdly funny segments are brimming with excitement. Virtual-san wa Miteiru is a one-of-a-kind comedy certain to bring delight to any fan of Virtual YouTubers!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is the story of a natural born liar, whose red-eye ability grants him the power to deceive, changing his appearance on a whim. But this poor boy no longer remembers his true self. Behind the mask is Kano himself, but this story is surely another lie... right?\n\nLost Time Memory\nIn one's life, there are many choices. Shintarou Kisaragi, haunted by the decisions of his past, locks himself in his room to cope. But still, he has choices. To persevere, he may finally be able to move on. Or will he remain in the past, only to drown in his regrets? No matter his choice, he will be forced to remember.\n\nAyano no Koufuku Riron\nAyano Tateyama's family expands when her parents adopt three red-eyed orphans. Sadness clings to these children, but Ayano wants to be the best big sister for them. Donning a red scarf, she shows the beauty of their red eyes and starts a secret club called the Mekakushi-dan. Ayano's family is her bliss, and she will do whatever it takes to protect their happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

Frustrated, he plans on returning things to their past state, but his mother threw the Moshimo-box away. \n\nOne day, Doraemon and his friends meet Professor Mangetsu, who studies magic and magical beings such as goblins, and his daughter Miyoko, and are warned of the dangerous approximation of the \"star of the Underworld\" to the Earth's orbit. \n\nWith the future of the planet at stake, the group must travel to the Underworld and pierce the heart of the Underworld King with a silver dart, as detailed in the ancient texts of \"The Chronicles of the Underworld\". Their attempts are, however, thwarted and Miyoko captured. \n\nDoraemon and his friends then decided to use the Time Machine to return to the past and, using Dorami's Moshimo-box, they manage to restore the Earth. The events on the Underworld continue, however, to take place in a Parallel Universe, where Miyoko is still captive. As a result, the group is once again forced to travel to the Underworld and defeat its tyrannical ruler once and for all. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Musique concr\u00e8te and electronic sounds made by modulating everyday noises such as flush toilets are interspersed throughout the work. Contrasts between opposites, as encapsulated by the title\u2014between live-action space and animated space, between mundane sounds of daily life and bizarre noises\u2014and the war between the sexes, a signature theme in Youji Kuri's work, are also palpable in the juxtaposition of musique concr\u00e8te and scat singing.\n\n(Source: Collaborative Cataloging Japan, edited)",

Suddenly, masked assassins break in and begin to shoot everything that moves. Zenigata goes after Lupin amidst all the gunfire and corners him in the courtyard of the house. Suddenly, a hand holding a Walther P-38 pops out of a window and shoots Zenigata in the chest. Lupin recognizes the Walther as his own and decides to investigate. The assassins that attacked the party are from a hidden island called the Island of Assassins. The island is kept secret by the help of top government officials from around the world who use the assassins on the island for their own personal gains. There are lots of hidden secrets on the island, however, and Lupin, Goemon, Jigen, and Fujiko find themselves involved in a plot that tears the residents of the island in half. The movie also delves into Lupin's past in his pre-Jigen days. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

        "synopsis": "Kou is a member of the public morals committee at Moriyaji Gakuen, along with his childhood friend Ai and kouhai Karen. One day while he was making the rounds after school, he was attacked by a weird being. He was frozen in fear and could not evade its attack, but he was saved by two girls, Konoka and Lizera. They were \u2018daemon busters\u2019 who fight against daemons borne from the lust and cravings of humans. They told him that he was a kyuumashi who could absorb the desires that create daemons, and they asked for his help since his special ability makes their battles much easier. When he uses his ability, it causes him to be able to see girls naked and also makes them horny. If the daemons aren\u2019t defeated, then their lust will cause the whole school to become an orgy. As part of the public morals committee, he can\u2019t let that happen!\n\n(Source: Hau~ Omochikaeri!)",

Shinji doesn't feel much for inheriting a company from a person he doesn't know, especially since he has plans for his own life and wants to eventually marry his childhood friend Sae. There is only a slight drawback: his grandfather won\u2019t take no for an answer. He did leave an opt-out option though; if Shinji can find a girl with a certain birthmark, he will be given his freedom and won\u2019t have to inherit and lead the company. The only catch is\u2026 the birthmark will only appear after the girl climaxes. How will Shinji manage to get out of this deal while still staying true to his childhood love?",

He always thought his life was ordinary, besides the fact that he can't remember what happened in his youth. One sunny day as he is taking a nap on a bench, a redheaded girl -- Mikoto -- literally falls on him from the sky. For some reason, she thinks he's her younger brother. Naoki's time period is a temporal shelter for those in the future, when many are suffering from an incurable disease. When she heard her younger brother Yuusuke had been taken to Naoki's time, Mikoto herself had gone back in time.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

She is useless at her job but is blackmailing her boss so she won't get fired. One day she runs into a gorgeous young man who she takes to bed. She meets into a perverted talking cat with a butterfly on its forehead, who recruits her to be a magical soldier. She has to fight off a dominatrix elf woman called Beene, a minion of Regina Apis, a matriarch bent on chaos and forming her new Dynasty. Tsubomi is learning of her powers when she is rescued by an oddly familiar masked man, known only as Dandelion. The plot of this anime is completely farcical and parodies the magical girl genre and Sailor Moon in particular. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

It's played on English audio with Japanese subtitles. It also included a little book which explains the life on El Pueblo before and the arrival of Osmund Saddler. It also solved some plot holes like the whereabouts of the children. It contains many of the scenes original to Resident Evil 4.\n\n(Source: Resident Evil Wiki)",

Miyazawa often used animals as the main characters in his stories and poems, and it is this technique that allows director Shoji Kawamori to recreate Miyazawa's fanciful land of Ihatov and use it as the backdrop for Miyazawa's life. Beautiful and affecting, Spring and Chaos is a fitting tribute to one of Japan's greatest writers.\n\n(Source: Rotten Tomatoes)",

The beasts are relentless and seemingly have no end to their numbers, while the population of defenders dwindle in every skirmish. Even in the town of Minea, where the people are safely nestled behind castle walls, the constant attacks have left them hopeless. It is then that a prophecy is made, proclaiming the arrival of a brave young soul that could be the one who will bring their salvation.\n\nYs follows Adol Christin, an adventurer driven by wanderlust towards the island of Esteria, who washes up on shore after a shipwreck. Following the guidance of the fortuneteller Sarah Tovah, he and his allies will travel the island in search of the legendary tomes known as the Books of Ys. It will be a long and perilous journey, but if fate is truly at work then Adol will certainly be the hero who returns peace to Esteria.",

She was now a nurse and showed him around during his busy training days.\n\nOne day, he fell down the stairs while protecting her and broke his right arm and left leg. As a result, his residency was put on hold while he was hospitalized. He was placed in Mio\u2019s ward and she felt responsible for the accident. To cheer her up, he suggested that she could take care of him whenever she has free time, to which she readily agreed. It is the beginning of a hospital love story between a medical intern and a nurse who would go above her duties to take care of him.\n\n(Source: VNDB)",

Luckily, Fauna decides on an alternate means of stopping the demon, which involves lots of sex with her and sexy older sister (and love potion maker) Jordh. Unluckily, there's Natsuki, a little devil with plans of her own for Kousuke. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ",

However, by the start of the 21st century, two meteors struck the planet, sending humanity into chaos. By the year 179 of the Space Era, secret technology, dubbed Extra-Over Technology, or EOT, was discovered by the Earth Federal Government within a third meteor that hit Earth in the Marquesas Islands of the South Pacific. Dr. Bian Zoldark, head of the EOTI Institute (Extra-Over Technological Investigative Institute), had evidence the creators of the EOT were heading to Earth, in order to reclaim it...or worse, invade the planet. In order to defend humanity from extraterrestrial threats, the government begins to research and develop humanoid mecha called Personal Troopers.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

She is greeted as \"Alice\" by twins known as Light and Shadow, who express their relief at Alice's return home. Arisa is insistent that she is not the Alice they speak of, but the strange characters of this world are adamant that she is.\n\nUpon meeting the kind and mysterious Black Rabbit, she learns that she is trapped in a place called Wonderland with no apparent escape. As she adjusts to her new reality, Arisa comes to find a whole host of peculiar creatures, such as the affectionate Cheshire Cat and the lazy dormouse Round.\n\nBut there is more to Wonderland than meets the eye. Each of the wild personalities she now shares a home with resembles someone she knew in her other life, yet not a single one of them recognizes their old name or relationships. Even stranger is the fact that time in Wonderland seems to never change, as every day is the same as the last. There appears to be no end to this cycle\u2014beyond whatever secrets the Black Rabbit is keeping.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Crusher Joe heads a small team of these outer space troubleshooters that includes the cyborg Talos, the beautiful Alfin, and the obligatory kid sidekick Ricky. A routine assignment escorting a cryogenically frozen heiress to a medical facility goes awry when the girl goes missing and Joe and his team are left holding the bag. It seems space pirates are trying to play the Crushers for patsies, but Joe doesn\u2019t take kindly to the setup and tracks the pirates to their home world. The four heroes not only have to rescue their human cargo but take down the pirates in the process, which involves a heck of a lot of space dogfights, explosions, and good old-fashioned hand-to-hand combat. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Like previous Pok\u00e9mon planetarium anime, this one was projected onto 360-degree panoramic domes.\n\nThe story follows Satoshi and his friends when they visit the Pok\u00e9mon Aerospace eXploration Agency (a nod to the real-life Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency).\n\nThey are thrilled by stories from PAXA's astronauts about the wonders of space and the possibility of Pok\u00e9mon living in space. Then, just as they hear about the dangers posed by space debris, sirens suddenly ring out. Team Rocket have plotted to seize control of PAXA and have apparently infiltrated the facility.\n\nAt that critical moment, trouble develops in a control system for artificial satellites. Large pieces of space debris have collided, causing fears of even more debris.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Unfortunately, the only way to save the Earth is by having three people with extraordinary potential demonstrate a new skill on a crane game, which will create a beam of energy able to divert the asteroids.\n\nThe only three people with enough potential are three high school girls\u2014Asuka, Mirai, and Kyouko. In order to harness their energy, Saya tells them that she has scouted them as idols and has them work at an arcade where she can monitor them. She says to the girls that all successful idols are good at crane games, and that building their skills is their first step in idol training. As the girls learn new crane game techniques, they begin to doubt Saya's intentions but are nonetheless unaware that the fate of the Earth lies in their hands.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

This results in a large-scale athletic tournament, the \"Daiundoukai,\" where several aspiring female athletes from all around the solar system compete. The winner of the tournament is crowned the \"Cosmo Beauty,\" obtaining a queenlike status.\n\nWhen outgoing potato farmer Kanata Akehoshi was a child, she witnessed a meteor-like object falling from the sky, crashing in a nearby forest. When she came to investigate the wreckage, she saw a damaged spaceship and a girl who seemed to have been in it weakened by the impact. The girl gave Kanata two wristbands, alongside a request that Kanata join the Daiundoukai and become the Cosmo Beauty. Kanata obliged, but before she could ask for the girl's name, she mysteriously disappeared\u2014leaving nothing,not even the crater caused by the crash. Since then, Kanata has devoted herself to training, aiming to fulfill her promise.\n\nAfter winning the qualifying round to represent the planet Earth, Kanata goes to the University Satellite\u2014an institution where she and other candidates study to prepare themselves for the upcoming competition. There, she meets and befriends her fellow competitors, helping them get along with each other to perform better in the games. As Kanata grows closer to the coveted title, so do her chances of meeting the girl who changed her fate\u2014and she discovers an underlying mystery behind the Daiundoukai along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She'd fare better if she spent more time working and less time playing with the office equipment, but it wouldn't be near as much fun. Nana's so cute in her maid's outfit that it's easy to see why everyone wants a piece of her. And while domineering Mai is used to being the boss, she's going to discover the joys of humiliation. A taste will only leave you wanting more, so obey your sweet tooth.\n\nVolume #2: Heat Wave (Eps #4-6)\n\nSayaka is trying to be a prim and proper teacher, but every time she steps in front of a classroom she gets hot... And turning up the air conditioner isn't going bring her temperature down one bit. Misuzu may be a world-class swimmer, but the cold water in the practice pool only heats things up. She's one bathing beauty who doesn't need a sauna to make things steamy. The heat index will soar as these two lovely ladies do their best to set the screen on fire.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

In opposition to this plan are the slightly nutty Kyuusaku Natsume and Nuku Nuku, the android who acts as a companion to his young son. Nuku Nuku's classmates are all eccentrics, Futaba, the class president, is a domineering control-freak, who cannot leave her authority in school. Chieko Shirakaba is the rich snob with the two yes-girls who always take her side. There is a bookworm, a mystic, a scientist, and a pop singer. All of these are true to their descriptions: the mystic is always foretelling doom via tarot cards, spirits, or some other occult technique. The pop singer never says anything except as a song. The bookworm always has her nose in a book. These eccentricities add to the series' humor. \n\n(Source: ANN)",
