The anime will illustrate lessons learned from the March 11, 2011 Tohoku (Northeastern Japan) earthquake and tsunami, and emphasize the importance of constant preparedness and disaster prevention and readiness. \n\nThe anime will be 60 minutes long and will have two parts titled \"Sonaeru\" (Prepare) and \"Manabu\" (Learn), focusing on true stories from Iwate prefecture's Fudai village and Kamaishi City. \n\n\"Sonaeru\" is set during the 1970s to 1980s, and focuses on the story of Kotoku Wamura, the mayor of the village Fudai at the time, as he attempts to persuade the village assembly that his proposed floodgate and seawall project is not useless. He remembers the 1896 and 1933 Sanriku earthquakes and tsunamis in proposing the project. The 15.5-meter (51-foot) floodgate \u2014 the highest in the Tohoku region \u2014 ends up sparing Fudai the damage that the 2011 tsunami subjected other coastal towns. \n\n\"Manabu\" centers on elementary school children in Kamaishi City during the 2011 disaster, illustrating their lessons learned in disaster readiness to head to higher ground. The story will show \"Tsunami Tendenko,\" a local custom telling people to individually seek higher ground on their own initiative, in a lesson that the children would teach their parents. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

The scrolls are considered an Important Cultural Property, and were first displayed together for the first time in 2012. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

While conducting training exercises 80 miles off Okinawa, an A4 strike aircraft is loaded with a B43 hydrogen bomb, but it falls overboard and sinks in 16,000 feet of water. Based on the true story of the USS Ticonderoga, which reached Japan two days later (on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor; nice touch). Neither side revealed the incident, nor that she was carrying atomic weapons in contravention of U.S. treaties with Japan. The plane, its pilot, and the bomb were never recovered, and the incident was only declassified in 1989, causing an outcry in Japan and resulting in this environmentally themed anime. The extra \"n\" in Ticonderonga may be a genuine error in transcription or an attempt to distance the story from real events, since the anime continues with Ashika, a boy from a Japanese fishing town, contacted by telepathic whales who bring him visions of fearful seamonsters. Then again, if you were a whale given a choice between nuclear contamination and talking to Japanese fishermen, which would you choose?\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)",

The line between doing plagiarism and doing a homage seems ambiguous, and the truth is that that line doesn't exist anywhere. It holds true even when the role is reversed. A homage holds a great risk of becoming plagiarism. The lyrics to this song pays homage to Ozaki Housai's haiku and his final years of life.\n\n(Source: YouTube)",

There are various tasks to be done in the community, such as repairing large vehicles, constructing weird buildings, operating quaint shops, and delivering weird packages. The energetic Dr. Panda can always lend a helping hand. By helping his friends and serving the community, he can find fun in a new career or task every day. Because he is full of curiosity and likes to find fun, Dr. Panda can always turn every new challenge into an adventure for himself and his animal friends. Dr. Panda likes each of his friends because they all have unique skills and small habits. Dr. Panda likes to be at the forefront of the team. He believes in proactiveness more than waiting and watching. However, his strong self-confidence is also a small shortcoming, which makes him unable to foresee possible problems. At first glance, this cute little panda seems to lack the ability to solve problems, because he often counts one step at a time. But with his enterprising spirit and optimistic attitude towards life, no matter how difficult the task is, he can be easily solved. He can always find a new perspective or clever way, because he always has a unique insight into the situation before him. When he asks his animal friends for help, most of them need to step out of their comfort zone to adapt to his childlike way of thinking. But in the end, they are always happy to help, because they know that with Dr. Panda, an ordinary day can become an exciting roller coaster journey! \n(translated from qq)",

They are always broke and looking for that night's supper. Their hunger drives them into some very strange situations or causes them to hatch some pretty weird schemes.\n\nThis animation is made with 1:12\" and 1:24\" scale miniture backgrounds and props, which creates a feeling of traditional stop motion animation. The mixture of these analog and digital techniques creates a very original harmony. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
