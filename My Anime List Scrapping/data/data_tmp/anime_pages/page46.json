As a single parent, she decided to apply for the performance group of the school's Xiaokun class because she wanted to save her mother's talent class fees. Momo from the same school is a lively and active, well-known naughty ghost who always beats the rhythm of the B-BOX.\nFanfan really doesn't know how she got into this nasty guy. She was first forced to look for crickets by Mo Mo, and then frightened by Mo Mo who was wearing a costume and pretending to be a ghost. On the day of the enrollment examination for the Little Kun Class, Mo Mo accidentally broke his cherished tune flute and lost the opportunity to apply for the performance group.\nIn order to make up for the mistake, Momo strongly encouraged the sad fans to change to the actor group. Fans who originally didn't have confidence in themselves were very happy after being admitted to the small Kunban cast. In Xiaokun's class, Fanfan met the daughter of the parent president's delicate and arrogant voice, and the model student who is very disciplined by Wen Sheng, as well as classmates who love to play treasures such as Cai Bao and Jia Yi Sheng. Having always lacked self-confidence, she also defeated herself in mutual help with Momo. In the end, the two stood together on the stage for the public performance (translated from baidu baike)",

Piracy\" clip featuring the characters from the Sgt. Frog anime franchise has been produced. In Japan, the anti-piracy video series featuring a camera-headed character named \"Eiga Dorobou\" (Movie Thief) is shown before every movie screening. In this clip, Eiga Dorobou performs with Keroro, who is trying to access pirated anime and manga without knowing its illegality, along with his friends.\n\nMAGP was launched in July 2013 in order for manga publishers and animation-related companies to cross-sectionally share information on piracy in Japan and abroad, investigate the actual situation, and take countermeasures. This new \"Stop! Piracy\" video was produced to inform the public that the illegal downloading of infringing content, which was previously limited to movies and music works, now covers all copyrighted works due to the revised Copyright Act, which came into effect on January 1, 2021. The clip will be screened in 75 theaters in the Kanto area from December 24. \n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

Since submarines Olly and Beth are ocean explorers, they set out to find the rainbow treasure, but a whole bunch of bad guys are looking for it too. Like Snarky Sharkskin and his slippery Seahorse Gang. When the treasure's good Sea Lion Guardians turn into evil Sea Lion Pirates, the rainbow is in deep danger. If they steal the treasure, then all the rainbows in the whole world will be lost forever. Oh no. How can Olly and Beth save the rainbow? There's only one way. \"Dive, Olly, Dive!\"\n\n(Source: IMDb)",

        "synopsis": "This film consists of 6 animated shorts produced by the Human Rights Commission of Korea.  Like the previous movie, the stories deal with seeing the world through the eyes of people who are different from social norms.  The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature in 2008 from the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.\n\n1. \"The Third Wish\u201d (AN Dong-hui, RYU Jeong-wu). A fairy godmother appears before a visually impaired young woman to grant her three wishes. But this is no fairytale. The irritable middle-aged fairy wants to finish her job as soon as possible. Yet she proves to be helpful as she leads the woman through a busy marketplace, which is delightfully reminiscent of \"Amelie\". But it's no walk in the park, as busy urbanites show no consideration for our protagonist. Yet she prevails through obstacles. With a walking stick, she taps together the heels of her shiny new shoes and follows the \"yellow brick road\" (guiding tiles for the visually impaired) around the city.\n\n2. \"Ajukari\u201d (HONG Deok-pyo) is a street-style cartoon. It comically depicts how a certain macho \"complex\" can cripple men. Male circumcision becomes the ultimate standard for being \"manly\" and those who have failed to do the deed are forever fearful of going to public baths.\n\n3. \"Baby\" (LEE Hong-su, LEE Hong-min) portrays the difficulties a career woman faces in having a child. \"I'm not saying you can't have maternity leave, but can you afford to raise a child while working?\" asks her boss. This smart story portrays everything from mother and daughter-in-law relationships to a parody of \"Tazza: The High Rollers\" and hilarious episodes where an \"ambulance bus\" picks up several patients en route.\n\n4. \"Shine Shine Shining\" (KWON Mi-jeong) is drawn like a warm, watercolor storybook for children. Grade schooler Eun-jin is smart and popular, but she has a secret. She hides her curly hair, which she gets from her Filipino mother, in braids.\n\n5. \"Merry Golasmas\" is an adorable claymation, or stop motion animation of models constructed from clay, plasticine, etc. It explores physical discrimination or stereotypes. In an open audition to find a Santa Claus, the real Santas \u2015 one who's black, another who's Asian, a female Santa and one in a wheelchair \u2015 lose to a fake Santa, a pot-bellied, Caucasian.\n\n6. \u201cLies\" explores homosexuality. Drawn in pastel-like sketches with art deco-esque details, it is a stunning digital cut-out animation, A homosexual man is forced by his parents to marry a woman, while others are pressured to fake having a girlfriend or receive \"therapy\" to become straight.\n\n(Source: The Korean Times)",

If you enter a night club, you'll find young people dancing to blaring trance music. However, you will also find that they wear kimonos, that the darkness is illuminated by candles, and that the stage is covered by tatami mats! While the people reflect the fashions and manners of the Edo Era, they reside within a strange world where the \"present\" and the \"past\" coexist.\n\nWelcome to the Yoshimune world that no one has ever seen! \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

During the 1970s, actress Mariko Miyagi became heavily involved in the Silk Tree Academy (Nemunoki Gakuen), a rehabilitation center for disabled children. She appeared in several live-action films to promote the project, including The Silk Tree Ballad, Mariko-Mother, and Children Drawing Rainbows. This anime charts the 14-year period of Miyagi's stewardship of the academy and her relationships with several of the children. Divided into four seasonal chapters, the film uses highly realistic character designs based on the actual people involved and features storyboarding from the versatile Star Blazers-director Noboru Ishiguro.\n\n(Source: AnimeVice)",

As the doctor ages, they might not be able to help their patients as much. If the doctor dies of old age, the clinic's patients would suffer if they needed medical attention ASAP or suffer confusion as to how to transfer to another clinic with their medical records. The Doctor to Doctor Concierge service Sougou Medical Koushiki helps team up younger doctors with older doctors so that in the event the older doctor can not longer take care of their patients, the younger doctor would be fully equipped to take over so that no patients are neglected or left behind.\n\nThe second video is about their Sougou Yakkyoku service. The company provides a pharmacist to explain what medications are, when to take them, and offers easy directions with big visual guides. Some elderly patients get confused or have difficulty reading when there are so many medications to take. So this service it meant to take away the pressure and guilt they might feel from not being able to follow along the back of the packages. ",

It is meant to encourage children to help the environment.\n\nOne day a terrible fire broke out in a forest - a huge woodlands was suddenly engulfed by a raging wild fire. Frightened, all the animals fled their homes and ran out of the forest. As they came to the edge of a stream they stopped to watch the fire and they were feeling very discouraged and powerless. They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes. Every one of them thought there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird.\n\nThis particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, \"Don't bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it\u2019s only a drop, you can't put out this fire.\"\n\nAnd as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird\u2019s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a mocking voice, \"What do you think you are doing?\" And the hummingbird, without wasting time or losing a beat, looked back and said, \"I am doing what I can.\"\n\n(Source: sechangersoi.be)",

Due to the end of the great nautical era, this place has gradually been forgotten. The island is now a beautiful and tranquil island, far away from the hustle and bustle, people love peace, and live a simple and happy life. However, a man named Blackbeard Dickey People often come to the sky island under the guise of \"promoting trade\", forcing the islanders to exchange unequal goods with him, disturbing the peaceful life here...\n\u3000\u3000 Bobo is an orphan, living alone in a tree house on the sky island. He has a treasure, it is the captain's diary, but because he is illiterate, he knows little about the contents of the diary. In addition, because his childhood memories and fantasy are intertwined, the true origin of this diary has become confusing, but he has always stubbornly believed that he is the son of a great pirate. His dream is to one day become a great pirate and explorer, and find his father.(translated from iqiyi)",

When he reaches adulthood, he is thrown into the harsh, violent world of Japanese gangland when his mother becomes involved in a gang-related crime. He goes up against the Murata-gumi organization, only to find that his estranged father is its head. Rising up through the ranks, Kyosuke eventually unites half the gangs in Japan beneath his own leadership, only to find that the other half have also combined to resist his new power, starting the greatest gang war in Japanese history. \n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)",

Between the aches of being a girl who's younger than her body looks or a boy who'd rather get into fist fights than give handshakes, we found a piece of ourselves within the outcasted teens that's abnormal. Like a four leaf clover. Which are said to bring luck even though it is a mutant in the sea of three leaves. And so the curtain rises to glimpse at these four leaf Clovers--4 boys and 3 girls.\n\n(Source: Studio Kaab) ",

Some local men were about to be blamed for the fire but the squirrel vouches for them as he knew these specific men did not start it. The squirrel found a kitsune who said she used her shape-shifting to mess with a hunter that was trying to hunt her. During this the hunter dropped a lit rope fuse to his gun which caused the forest fire. The squirrel reported the events with the kitsune and the hunter was found and punished.\n",

Hissawwaza was shown only in TOHO Cinemas Shinjuku in honor of the theater's grand opening as well as being a collaboration with the Godzilla franchise and Tokyo Metro's new IC Touch campaign).\n\nNone of these episodes were released online at a later date nor included in any DVD release of Kamiusagi Rope.\n",

Families who used to live in a simple wooden home suddenly had the luxuries of TV, refrigerators, kotatsu, rice cookers, etc. Unfortunately the rapid progression left a gap of ignorance which led to many fires most commonly from leaving heat-generating products unattended as well as overloading sockets.",

Although they abandoned Eun-sil in the past, will they be able to protect her baby until the end?\n\n(Source: HanCinema)\n",
