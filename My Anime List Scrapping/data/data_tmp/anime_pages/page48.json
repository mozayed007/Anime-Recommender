Every time his mother scolded him, his father's body shrank a little, and in the end he shrank to the size of his thumb. After getting smaller, his father's mind became very agile. He invented a series of things: cash cow, smart rice, dream maker, brainwashing gun, etc. These inventions brought earth-shaking changes to Yang Ge's family and the entire society. At the same time, terrorists also focused on his father's invention, and wanted to use his father's invention for evil. Can Yang Ge and his father defeat the terrorists and protect the earth?

The protagonist Kidd\u2019s father is the commander of the space fleet and is not at home all year round. In order to get the attention of his father, the young Kidd proved that he had grown up and ran away from home to invade the earth. Who knew that I accidentally fell on the African savannah and became good friends with the animals on the grassland (?). Especially its \"hardcore\" little lion Alin. Everyone was playing happily on the prairie. Kidd\u2019s aggressive plan is also underway today. Will it succeed? Let's wait and see! (translated from iqiyi)",
