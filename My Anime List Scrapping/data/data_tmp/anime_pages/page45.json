A group of scientists launched the \"Cube Project (HEXA)\", which aims to explore and find a habitable planet in space. The fully automatic artificial super-intelligent supercomputer HEXA was launched into space. After 100 years of deep space exploration, it finally found a habitable planet for humans. Unfortunately, HEXA has lost contact with the earth due to flying too far, so HEXA considers using space wormholes to return to the past of the earth. HEXA uses the resources of the new planet to produce a batch of \"Cube Robots (EXAGON)\". The basic structure of the cube robots is exactly the same. They can carry different equipment to achieve different superpowers. The purpose of producing \"cubic robots\" is to allow them to travel through space wormholes, travel back to the past of the earth, and bring humans to a new livable planet. Because HEXA can't judge how to use the wormhole to return to the accurate age of the earth, in order to prevent the \"Cube Robot\" from affecting the history of the earth, based on the DNA of the scientists who developed the \"Cube Project\" at that time, different robots were bound with different DNA and equipment. Determined that these \u201ccube robots\u201d are required to find their own set of scientists and safely transfer them \n(translated from iqiyi)",

The alien, who claim to be from Saturn, tells the absurd reason for their invasion of Earth, and that the key to the invasion plan is to make Lu Fan fall in love with him and then betray the Earth.\n\nIn the funny daily life with the Saturnian, aliens from various planets start to appear around Lu Fan one after another! These aliens have their own objectives, but because of their intertwined destinies, they all end up in Beijing. Lu Fan begins to realize that she is not as ordinary as she thought, and she slowly develops a crush on the Saturnian. How will she choose?\n\n(Source: iQIYI)",

It was said that the Frog King would grant any wish if one beat the big snake with the sword. When Lily beat the snake, she went to the Frog Land and met the Frog King. The king said she would become a frog if she couldn't open the Gate of Hope until a child would hatch from the roe in front of her. Suddenly, a man in suits appeared. His name was Knodo, and he was supposed to become her little brother. Lily thought it strange, and she ran away from him. He chased her. Then, they fell over into the water head over heels.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

        "synopsis": "The show centers around three hobos that live in a broken car on top of a junkyard: Punch, Touch, and Boom. Punch is a bear who is literally strong-headed: his head is as hard as a rock, and nothing can knock him down. Boom the weasel is an expert shot, using not a gun, but a slingshot. Touch the mouse takes advantage of her smallness in order to get into small holes and sneaking into things without the villains knowing. \n\nGari-Gari is a mad scientist wolf who wants to build a mansion over the junkyard, constantly thinking up evil plans to get the money needed to buy the property, whether it\u2019s creating a machine that creates counterfeit 10 yen (about 10 cents in US money) or stealing priceless paintings and selling it to a high bidder. He is an inventor, creating things that can aid him into doing his deed. If Gari-Gari buys the junkyard, this of course means that the three heroes will have no place to stay, so they constantly thwart his schemes. Gari-Gari has two henchmen working for him: Black and Nyu. Black is a gangster cat who welds a gun, often shooting at Punch and the gang with it. Nyu is a simple-minded pig who has big strength. \n\n(Source: Cartoon Research)\n\n*Based on Hustle Punch by Mori Yasuji, serialized in Manga O.",

When Rikotto and Zuzu get captured by a circus ringleader who intends to put them on display, Paroru has to decide what fears he is willing to face for his friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The audience is expected to be enamored with this vehicle. At one scene when it looks like the tank is sure to get away, the background music turns into cocktail-lounge jazz and sparkly lights swirl around the tank. The tank carries six ATGM launchers (which Ken is somehow able to dislodge with minimal trouble, along with a piece of the turret, towards the end of the movie), three to each side of the turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank's treads are dual-mounted (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank).\n\nThe employment of the laser, however, seems counter-productive to a machine-gun's mission, as it can only fire once every few seconds. If it can fire at higher rates, it does not do so, and tries to acquire a lock on its pursuer (Blader, in this case). This suggests a low ammunition capacity, unlike thousand-round-and-up machine-guns routinely mounted on modern tanks. It does not appear to have any effect on the road, either, which does not say much about its power.\n\nAnother tank involved is the MBT-90D, which are dispatched by the Army (or Air Force\u2014the movie never makes it clear if it is a joint effort, although the general who arrives midway into the movie is shown riding in something resembling an ADATS) to take out the tank. Despite having at least a platoon of these, the MBT-99 still evades capture. The M-90Ds are armed with a three-barreled autocannon, the calibre of which may be around fifteen to twenty millimeters. The MBT-90D is equipped with three ATGM missile launchers, on the left side of the turret, and its main cannon is mounted on the front, instead of on a turret.\n\nAfter the MBT-99's hijackers (who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently-committed bank robbery), hired by a shadowy group, backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military (the M-99 is presumably on its way to be tested at a separate base), are forced out by Ken and his team, Eleanor enters to study the tank, and it starts up on its own, having been programmed by the hijackers to head for a pier and drive off its end so as to rendezvous with an enemy submarine. The rest of the movie is made up of the chase through the city, resulting in the destruction of another bank (owned by the same corporation that built the first bank in the movie), and various collateral damage.",

Essential Free & Easy Cool Wax Shampoo and Conditioner are real products Kao Japan makes, they are meant to help remove hair wax from men's hair and condition the hair so it is more receptive to new wax when the hair is then dried and styled again. Takashi Taniguchi known for his bizarre animation style, animated the web commercial. It's a ballad of a man who is in pain from having to scrub out his hair wax every day and frustratingly pulls his hair as he has to restyle the next day. An anthropomorphic Essential Free & Easy Cool Wax Shampoo and Conditioner tell him to use them so that his pain can go away. He is very happy with the results.\n",

From the stratosphere come five beautiful nymphs in the shape of angels, bearing the fragrance of forbidden fruit. It appears their desire is to bring pleasure to the devastated human race. A young programmer working late spots one of the beautiful girls on his balcony, peeping on a couple across the way. Once she departs he is surprised to find the scent of fruit lingering in the air. He knows he must pursue her, what he is yet to discover is that she's not of this Earth! \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The most knowledgeable people do not know its location, and the most detailed maps will not include its traces. This is the Valley of the Giants. In the Valley of the Giants, the energy guardian Maqiu (voiced by Zhang Qi) lives, and its existence is related to the safety of the entire world.\n\u3000\u3000One day, the iron hoof of the evil Enzo (voiced by Zhao Lu) broke through the tranquility of the Giants Valley, and its chicken and bull troops attacked the Giants Valley and took away the sleeping ball. The departure of Maqiu brought a heavy blow to the Valley of the Giants, and the entire valley was in crisis, a scene of hell. Enzo wants to achieve its ambition to rule the world by controlling the hemp ball. The righteous and kind Locke (voiced by Tao Dian) and Coricia (voiced by Guan Xiaotong) will naturally not let its conspiracy succeed.\n(translated from douban)",

At the cost of his own life, he entrusted a powerful \"Magic Wisdom Ball\" to Wang Xiaoer that could be used to save the environment. Wang Xiaoer instead used the ball for his own gain. When G.G. Bond is reincarnated and sees what Wang Xiaoer has done, he knows it is up to him to fix the problem, no matter what Wang Xiaoer tries to do to stop him.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
