Goku (who is still dead) suddenly appears in front of his sons with the help of his Instant Transmission, and joins them in the tub. While there, the three Saiyans reflect back on the events that occurred during the Cell Games. Inside the house after Chi-Chi appeared, Goku tells his sons about Pikkon and the Other World Tournament.\n\nLater, the four members of the Son family appear dressed nicely. Gohan says that the adult division of the Tournament will begin this next year (in 1994), and the special comes to an end.\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Wikia)",

The spunky and cute Nanba Teru (who\u2019s father owns the building when Jo and Takeshi reside in) frequently interferes in their affairs by threatening eviction (Jo is continually months behind in back rent). \n\nSince they rarely get any clients, they must resort to eavesdropping and spying on the Secret International Police Department headquarters, located in the building across from theirs in order to get their assignments. Unbeknownst to Jo and Teru, Takeshi has a deep secret. Not only is Takeshi the son of the International Police Department Chief but in times of peril and danger, mild-mannered Takeshi uses his trusty Poly-Met (Polymer Helmet) to transform into the Superhero \u201cHurricane\u201d Polymer, a red suited masked man with incredible fighting abilities and superhuman strength. The only one who knows Takeshi\u2019s secret is his lazy Saint Bernard, Daisaku, who always likes to provide cutting commentary to the audience (using his inner voice). \n\nTogether Jo and Takeshi (as Polymer) confront and battle a myriad of evil organizations, criminal gangs, mutants and monsters as they fight crime in the future city of Washinkyo (Washington/Tokyo).\n\n(Source: japanhero.com)",

Although he is feared by everyone due to his status, when her secret is exposed to the monster prince, she finds out that Juzu is in fact stupid, but is kind and just wanted a friend. With all the eyes of the students on Shushu and Juzu, the inconspicuous life Shushu so direly desired goes down the drain.\n\nNote: The third episode will begin streaming on December 4, 2014 to celebrate the release of the manga's first compiled book volume, which will ship in Japan the same day.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Through Enma's debriefing, Santa learns that the amount of greed and selfish behavior produced by humans will soon create an enormous wave of souls entering into Hell simultaneously, which would be catastrophic for Hell itself. \n\nSanta is given one mission: do something about it. With neither guidelines nor rules, Santa is tasked to handle the situation as he sees fit. In the human world, a rampaging thunderstorm strikes a nearby cemetery with a bolt of lightning, and the envoy of Hell appears. \n\nTeleported into the human world, Santa quickly realizes that humans are just as wicked as Enma had described. Without upsetting the balance between light and dark, Santa begins his quest to complete the mission from Hell and restore order to the human world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

A young man, enslaved by his own obsessive erotic wants, is magnetically attracted to an innocent-looking schoolgirl he observes outside of his home. Unable to control himself, he throws some of his most private bodily fluid on her, a liquid sign of his sexual desire. Surprisingly, she responds favourably to this bizarre come-on, and the two end up living in their own illicit world for the next several days. \n\n(Source: yahoo movies)",

Meanwhile his father Daisuke who was watching the test driving all the way recovered the wrecked car as his son`s memento. A few years later the damaged car rebuilt by him revives as the new Mach which comes to participate in Grand Prix. This time, however, for the purpose to protect the driver from a possible accident, the new car is equipped with a safety system called \"Safety Seven\" with seven guarding devices. Also, it is loaded with the engine \"X\" that miraculously survived the tragic accident. Now its driver is Go, younger brother of Kenichi, who is determined to succeed to his brother`s will. In fact, he successfully participates in Grand Prix and keeps growing up to be a top racer of the world.\n\n(Source: official site)",

Then, Kou, her childhood friend, appears and, due to Miyu losing her key, takes her to his home. There, Miyu confess her first kiss was stolen. However, Kou tells her they have already kissed, so it was not her first kiss.... That night, Kou takes Miyu's virginity.\n\nThe next day at school, Shun apologizes and invites her home. Miyu accepts, not knowing is a trap. There, Shun drugs her and trains her as sex slave. She resists it at first, but after that day, when she remembers that, she starts masturbating.

Foreigners living here are doing business in two realms at the same time, while keeping a secret that connects the two realms here. Gu Shaoning, a teenager of the human race, came to Chang'an Magic Street by accident and became acquainted with the alien race people living on this street. At the same time, the young man's original ordinary destiny has also undergone a change that shook the earth due to the unraveling of the secret of Chang'an Fantasy Street. Once the wheel of fortune is opened, it can only encourage the young man to grow and progress, but because of this, he is engaged step by step into the vortex of battle between sects and alien races.\n\n(Source: AnimeXin)",

The city of Tokyo was no exception.\n\nThe economy of Japan is crippled from this disaster and the government is willing for anything to help revive the country. As a result, the Japanese government forms \"JESAS\", a military foundation that has evil intentions of controlling Japan's future. JESAS handles the dumping of nuclear wastes into outer space.\n\nTo insure their protection from other countries, JESAS has developed \"R.B.\" Robotic Weaponry, which is controlled by pilots with \"A.I. (Accurate Intuition)\". On the opposite side of the law is the \"Green Frontier\", a united protection agency that was formed by countries sharing the same beliefs, to save the Earth.\n\nFeaturing JESAS pilots Kanna and Kazuto and Green Frontier's Doota Kang and Mira Yu, these four youngsters will decide the fate of the Earth through love, friendship and the passion for their duty.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in Ning\u2019s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both greater and yet also smaller than he ever could imagine. He would have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to himself, he would never let himself be weak again!

These disasters will always come true after Marty experiences the prophetic visions, but he is unable to predict accurately when and where they will occur.\nWhen the government learns about this, a unit is sent to protect Marty, and World Peacekeepers, abbreviated as WPK, is established to fight against the Black Armors. In order to defeat the Black Armors, the government grants permission for World Peacekeepers to use Ammobots \u2013 mechanical armors which have been developed over many years.\n\nAfter several battles with the Black Armors, the World Peacekeepers realizes that they are actually linked to the unusual natural disasters and discovers that they originate from a small planet called Mirzam, which is outside the solar system.\n\nTheir real intention is to seize the abundant ecological resources on Earth and when these resources are seized, the ecosystem will lose its balance, thus leading to natural disasters.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",

When a teacher is seduced by a student, he soon finds himself endowed with a power that the girls cannot resist... \n\n(Source: AniDB) ",

All of a sudden though, there was a suitcase in Nobita's room and intrigued as he was, he opened it only to find a portal to a beautiful resort managed by tin robots. Better still, it's absolutely free. However, it seems that there is a hidden agenda behind the person who invites them there.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

The first two were released on DVD bundled with two drama CDs, with the third being sold separately. It is unknown if these will ever be released outside of Japan.\n\nThe first OVA is a re-enactment of the first chapter, where Negi first learns of his job as a teacher and is introduced to the students of Mahora Academy 2-A. It ends with profiles of the Baka Rangers (Asuna, Makie, Yue, Ku Fei and Kaede) as well as Ayaka. Asuna is the only girl in the class that doesn't have romantic feelings for Negi.\n\nThe second OVA is a re-enactment of the \"love potion\" incident of chapter 2, with profiles at the end of Nodoka, Konoka, the cheerleaders (Misa, Madoka, Sakurako) as well as Kazumi.\n\nThe third OVA is a re-enactment of chapter 13: Negi's Mahora tour with the Narutaki twins. The tour shows Negi to several of the students (Yuna, Akira, Chao, Satsuki, Satomi, Chizuru, Natsumi, Zazie) as well as others that he ends up missing (Sayo, Evangeline, Chachamaru, Chisame, Misora, Ako). After being chewed out by Haruna for completely skipping her, a final scene introduces Setsuna and Mana, keeping watch from something on campus.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

However, Leben suddenly intruded into Carnea, and the two countries began to war. \n\nThe even fights had continued for more than six months, but when the king of Carnea died of illness, gradually Leben got the better of Carnea. \n\nIn these days, a man in a black suit visited Carnea. He had been a vice leader of the Carnea Knights, Claude, who had suddenly disappeared eight years before. His appearance had changed completely, and that made them suspicious. But when he said he had a plan to beat Leben, they gave their ears to him. He said that they would hire experienced mercenary solders, and that the queen and princesses would sell their bodies to earn money. The queen and her daughter accepted his plan, and they began to take his \"lessons\". \n\n(Source: AnimeNFO) ",

While the little girl is thrilled to see her favorite Tamagotchis in person, she soon realizes that she can't get home.

There are rumors that he may be a lunar cat, however this is not a documented fact, he may be a bit looney at times, yet his origin remains a mystery.\n\nRocky is quite innocent and unaware of the value of his special powers. He has the ability to turn children's fantasies into realities. The sky is the limit in the adventures he can create!\n\nOur story begins when Amy (Miki), a spirited young girl, joins her family on a camping trip. To her surprise, Amy discovers Rocky in her backpack among her camping gear. Rocky thinks Amy is his sister and he follows her everywhere.\n\nAmy is active and curious, yet she has a tendency to become frustrated and fed-up with the world around her. With Rocky's arrival, Amy's world changes drastically. Rocky uses his powers to turn Amy's dreams into real life adventures. Although Rocky's efforts are well intended, his efforts are not always successful. Occasionally these adventures \"short-circuit\" and become near disasters!\n\nThrough \"thick and thin\" Rocky and Amy become quite a pair and develop a long lasting friendship, experiencing a wide assortment of fun-filled escapades.

Advanced robots have survived the apocalypse, and Haruka lives with five who care for her: Spike, a boyish android who is very attached to her; Trigger, hot-tempered with a penchant for firearms; Cleric, the intelligent problem solver; Reeves, whose thoughtfulness overshadows his intimidating appearance; and Angela, a sword wielding recluse with an aversion towards humans. Residing in a high-rise building at the center of the city, Haruka lives a relatively peaceful life with her mechanical family.\n\nHowever, her life is far from a stable one. Not only is a lack of resources a concern, but violent, remnant robots from the war roam free, ready to destroy whomever they meet. Kurogane Communication follows Haruka as she tries to survive in an apocalyptic world while facing many dangers that will challenge her daily life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "One day Pop was out scavenging with Hana, and found a beautiful rose inside the Queen's garden. Curious, she picked the rose and brought it home. Unwittingly, that rose can cause all wishes to become true, whether good or bad. Good wishes will turn the rose white and bloom, while bad wishes will turn the rose black and wither. After a heated argument with her sister Doremi, Pop wishes that Doremi loses all her magic and be turned into a mouse. Hilarity ensues, as Doremi and the others try to put everything back to normal.\n\n(Source: ANN)\n",

Desperate, Momoko even considers selling her most precious possession - her mother's ring... But everything changes when Takaaki, a charming young man in her class, generously offers to pay her tuition if she simply agrees to work off her debt by serving as his own, personal, live-in maid. At least, the offer sounded generous at first... \n\nNow completely under Takaaki's control, Momoko has no choice but to satisfy his every twisted sexual fantasy. Yet Momoko isn't the only one he's drafting into this new maid service. Using blackmail and bribery, Takaaki's staff continues to grow with gorgeous young maids who are willing to serve him on their hands and knees. But even with all of this beauty surrounding him, for some inexplicable reason, Momoko still remains the target for his ever growing sadistic experiments. Could his unhealthy fixation lead to disaster? \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Mint Rondo is one of the many new tonttus arriving at Santa Company's tropical island office. Following in her older brother's footsteps, Mint begins training alongside her friend, Thomas Dou, and rival, Noah, to eventually become a Santa herself. Unfortunately, her clumsiness causes her to fall far behind her peers and into her brother's shadow.\n\nOne day, while sitting on the beach, Mint, Thomas, and Noah discover the biggest threat that Santa Company has faced yet: ocean pollution! With the accumulation of litter going unnoticed, the growing hazard will soon endanger the surrounding ocean wildlife and the members of the Santa Company. As trouble looms over the horizon, Mint might just be able to clean up her act and save everyone on the island in time for Christmas Eve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
