A police action with some robbers gets in her way, so she runs the robbers off the road. Her vision blurs and she gets into an accident. The movie splits into two with one plot following Remy's slow decline at the hospital with the Go Shogun members and former enemies at her side, and her experience in a strange city where she, and the rest of the team have their deaths foretold. Remy, herself, is plagued by visions of her death, and visitations from a threatening girl and her panther-like cat. The temple at the center of the city is the key, so the team sets out to battle their way into it. Based on the giant robot series \"Go Shogun\", this is a story focusing on Remy, the female member of the team. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The Rumbling Sky (Meidou no Sora)\n\nMuch like the Kidou Senshi Gundam theatrical movies, the Gundam Seed: Special Edition movies are intended to be an override of the story from the TV series.\n\nThese episodes are in fact a complete recap of all 50 episodes of the TV series and were first shown on television in Japan. The special edition episodes feature some new scenes and tweaks to previously animated scenes. The first special, The Empty Battlefield, which compiled episodes 1\u201321 of the series, was aired in two parts on Japanese TV in March 2004, followed by the next special, The Far-Away Dawn, which was episodes 22\u201340, in July 2004. The final special, The Rumbling Sky, which was episodes 41\u201350. While the story is overall unchanged, there are a few minor changes. In addition, several scenes are re-animated and re-dubbed.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Along the way, he teams up with a company of bandit mice and Pierre, a gentle orphan who has been cheated out of his inheritance.\n\nWhen Pero learns that Princess Rose is seeking a husband, he becomes determined to make sure that Pierre is the one chosen. However, Princess Rose is forcibly betrothed to the wicked ogre Lucifer! Pero begins to spin a web of lies to enthrall Rose with Pierre, but Pero's boasts are far from the truth. Pierre has to keep up with Pero's bold image of him but is frightened, because while Princess Rose is charming, loving her means going against the Devil's wishes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Doing things such as collecting medicinal herbs, exterminating magic beasts and wild beasts, and helping with the villagers' farm work, it's hard to decide whether to call our protagonist an adventurer or a handyman. And while doing these things his age quickly approached thirty. One day while searching the mountains for herbs, he discovered an abandoned child. Thinking that he couldn't just leave it, he took it home and raised it until his age approached forty.\n\nHis now grown-up daughter had also wanted to become an adventurer, likely from growing up watching her father. Although her father had taught her the sword since she was young for self-defense, her talent at it was quite impressive. Thinking that it would be better for her not to be stuck out in the country for the rest of her life, our protagonist sent her to the adventurer's guild in the Capital.\n\nAfter another five years, the protagonist now in his forties is still acting as a pseudo-adventurer in the countryside, however, his daughter\u2014now a distinguished S-Class adventurer\u2014hasn't returned home even once yet...\n\n(Source: MU, edited)",

There's a playful surrealist sensibility to Kago's work, as well as a tendency to revel in the ridiculous, the crude and the disturbing. His work straddles a weird boundary between avant-garde experimentation and low-brow fart jokes\u2014the punchline of one of these films is literally an oozing torrent of shit\u2014although, admittedly, his videos seem to lean a bit more heavily towards the fart jokes than his comics. But hey, who doesn't appreciate a good fart joke once in a while?\n\n(Source: Only the Cinema blog)",

Will she get the job?\n\nWife in the Box \nThe elevator stops suddenly. Trapped inside are a housewife and a salary-man. The man had pictured her naked body, and imagined having her. Surprised at first, the housewife would gradually scream in delight. Will the two be all right in the closed elevator...?\n\nPervert Brassiere \nWhen the cursed bra is worn, the wearer would be molested and raped; however, the curious Yoko tradeed it for her own bra, not knowing what would happen. Inside the company elevator on her way home, the molesting and rape begin. Is it the magic power of the curse or the power of lewdness and lust?\n\n(Source: RightStuf)",

Mana overflowed from their remains, drawing people who sought its power, and civilizations sprang up. People came to revere these mana-producing creatures, which they named 'Primordial Beasts'. They built their lives around them. Thus began the worship of the Primordial Beasts.\n\nTime flowed ever onward, to the present day... War erupts between the Jerle Federation, an alliance of countries who worship the Primordial Beasts, and the Gildllan Empire, which has enjoyed explosive development thanks to advanced technology. The fires of war burn ever brighter.\n\nThe special animated feature will tell an important juncture in the story of Luminaria, congealing and bringing to life the game's theme of \"confronting antagonistic ideas of justice\"!\n\n(Source: Official website)",

In a twist of fate, at five years of age, Eumiella recalls memories of her past life in Japan. Uninterested in the romance aspect of the original game, she begins to dedicate herself to training her rare dark-type magic.\n\nDespite this, Eumiella's goals are clear: avoid becoming the hidden boss and stay out of the limelight. Upon entering the magic academy, however, she shakes the foundation of the kingdom when her level 99 status comes to light. Whether a physical brawl or magic duel, her abilities are unmatched, and coupled with her black hair, she sticks out like a sore thumb. To make matters worse, the original heroine begins suspecting she is the demon lord! Can the deadpan noble girl achieve her wish of a peaceful life?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After some mixed up thoughts of who Sakura likes, Shizuka tells him he wishes to kiss him as a joke. But Sakura doesn\u2019t care; he still insists that the two kiss under the starry sky. After this incident, Shizuka thinks it\u2019s best for the two to be away from each other, so as to sort out their thoughts and real feelings. A classic shounen ai/yaoi, incorporating love, misunderstanding, violence and somewhat angst with a sweet end to it. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

Following a mix up at the hotel regarding their rooms, the group encounters treasure hunters and becomes acquainted with the island's treasure fever. Sent on a hunt of their very own, the Detective Boys scour the isle; while in far harsher waters, Conan discovers a murder. The police, following a clue from a recent robbery, arrive soon after, and Koumi is plunged into chaos. \n\nWhat follows is a mad dash by not only the treasure hunters but also the inhabitants of Koumi to secure Anne and Mary's long lost booty. All the while, however, Conan, Kogorou, and the police search for the one thing far greater than riches\u2014justice.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A decade later criminals discovered two of the surviving prototypes, #26 and 27 in the series, and used the remote controlled robots to commit a number of crimes. Young Shotaro Haneda, the twelve year old son of Dr.Haneda, did some investigating and discovered that the mob were hunting for the twenty-eighth robot in the series, rumoured to be the most powerful of them all. Racing the villains, Shotaro discovers the robot first, along with Dr.Shikashima, a colleague of his father's who was also believed killed by the Allied bombing. Together the two prevent Tetusjin-28 (the robot's official designation) from falling into the hands of the bad guys, and decide to dedicate him to peace rather than war.\n\nShotaro fought crime for a long time, supported by Dr.Shikashima, who would repair Tetsujin-28 when he was damaged, and by police officer Otsuka. Shotaro even battled the alien Magmans, invaders from the planet Magma, who came to Earth late in his career, bringing their own giant robots, Magma X and Gold Wolf, with them.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

All TVs and magazines pick it up and a lot of fans apply for it. The main character is Ryou. One day, he receives a parcel, which includes a film, an envelope and some erotic swimsuits for girls. \"What is it!?\" He opens the envelope, and finds a ticket to the tour and a letter. It says, \"If you take a photo using this film, their libido will become uncontrollable....\" \"Does this mean take a photo of the idols and make them wear these erotic swimsuits?\" But he is more interested in taking part in the tour because he also applied for it. He doesn't care if the film is fake or not. \"Great! I'll spend a happy time with them!\" Like this, he participates in the tour...\n\n(Source: ErogeShop)",

A 20-year trip passes, and the traveler has only aged 1 year. It definitely has its advantages, but after you've been on a few trips, it sure gets very lonely.\n\nRight now, however, that's not the big issue. The year is 2264. The Syncam Corporation has sent the Saldes and its crew of 13 (and 1 cat) out into deep space to explore the potential of a newfound planet 20 years away. Soon after they awaken from their stasis, however, things are happening one after another. First, the crew learns that two of the crew are not who they claim to be. Then, one by one, crewmembers die suddenly. Then, the ship begins to turn against them. And as if it couldn't get any worse, they find another mess on their hands and it is ugly.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a simple exploratory mission has become a struggle for survival in the depths of space. 20 years from home, they're all alone and no one can hear them scream.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

The ruler's two sons turned against each other, unleashing the powers of their Legendary familiars\u2014Reshiram and Zekrom\u2014and disturbing the Dragon Force that supplied the kingdom with energy. With the help of the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Victini, balance was restored and the Dragon Force was bound by the Sword of the Vale. Should the Sword be moved, devastation will loom again.\n\nDamon, a descendant of the now scattered People of the Vale, is attempting to restore his people's kingdom to its former glory. He manages to summon Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Zekrom, with the aim of lifting the Sword of the Vale and harnessing the power of the Dragon Force himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Satoshi and his companions visit Eindoak Town, located at the foot of the Sword of the Vale. Confronted with Damon's scheme, they lend a hand to Victini, guardian of the Vale, in stopping the plan from coming to fruition and preventing a repeat of the tragedy that occurred a millennium ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, her favorite mirror which was given to Akko by her mother (or in some versions, by her father, as a present from India) is broken, and she prefers to bury it in her yard rather than throw it to the trash can. In her dreams, she is contacted by a spirit (or in some cases the Queen of the Mirror Kingdom) who is moved that the little girl would treat the mirror so respectfully and not simply throw it away. Akko-chan is then given the gift of a magical mirror and taught an enchantment that will allow her to transform into anything she wishes.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Its inhabitants partake the journey to migrate back to Earth.\n\nAttempting to regenerate the Earth to make it hospitable, the migrants come up with a \"Zi-Forming\" scheme.\n\nHowever, the plan fails and Earth is left in its state of turmoil. Overrun by Zoids and blanked by unstable weather phenomena, the migrants are faced with a difficult life. The Empire and Republic settlements attempt to uncover Zoids buried within the Earth to bolster their respective armies.\n\nThe story picks up following second-generation Earth citizens: Leo Conrad and Buzz Cunningham, who have a chance encounter with a girl Sally Land as she flees the clutches of the Empire.\n\n(Source: Zoids Wiki)",

NBC thought that there was no way they could sell that kind of show, and they were quite happy with the 52 episodes they had, so the New Jungle Emperor series wasn`t seen in this country until 1984, when it was given the title Leo The Lion.\n\nThis series was supposed to take place a few years after the original Kimba series. Kimba was an adult, with Kitty as his mate, and they had two cubs. Most of all this series was the story of Rune, the male cub, as he grew and learned to be as strong as his father.\n\nFor legal reasons, the producers of the English-dubbed version could not use the name Kimba, so they used the original Japanese names for all the characters.\n\n(Source: Official Website)",

Junior high school student Kezuru wakes up after a strange dream featuring himself as a wizard, a creature called \"mazin,\" and a mysterious girl. The next day, his friend Kuracchi proudly shows off the newly launched Mazica Party card game. To Kezuru's shock, all the characters drawn in the game's cards are just like the ones in his dream.\n\nMeanwhile, Kezuru receives a notification for an event at the major international company Mazica. Intrigued, Kezuru goes to the Mazica Store as directed, only to meet the Mazica CEO himself, Jeff Johns. Johns says, \"I have great expectations for you,\" and hands Kezuru Mazica Gear.\n\nOn his way back home, Kezuru is attacked by an airship-like creature. Just when he thinks, \"this is it!\" to himself, his Mazica Gear erupts and a magic book appears. When he scratches a card, he seals a contract with Barunya, a \"mazin\" creature that is an odd remixed fusion between an airship and a cat.\n\nThe mysterious girl Anya says Kezuru and those of his ilk will be \"the true wizards who save the world.\" Amid all these mysterious revelations, Kezuru enrolls in the Mazica Academy and engages in Mazica Party card battles alongside his partner mazin.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

However, he was finally suppressed by a group of heroes who took his powers and sealed him deep underground. Two hundred years later, there were rumours that the seal was broken due to the recent shifts in the Earth\u2019s crust and that the maou had been revived. Many confident adventurers descended on Astaroth\u2019s underground labyrinth with the intention of defeating him and becoming famous. Little did they know that he had set out a trap for them\u2026\n\n(Source: Omochikaeri)",

After three hundred million years, the snowy mountains where the Paleozoic Pok\u00e9mon once lived are no longer habitable\u2014but not all of the race are actually extinct. Several specimens are still alive and desperate to find a new place to call home. Led by a Shiny Genesect and accompanied by the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Mewtwo, the vagabond creatures arrive in New Tork City.\n\nPerceiving the city skyline as similar to their initial habitat, the Genesect take over the city center, driving out other Pok\u00e9mon and threatening the existence of the local populace. On top of that, the Genesect leader confronts Mewtwo in a cunning, fast-paced duel that is bound to destroy the entire city\u2014and it's up to Satoshi and his companions to save the city and reconcile the feuding Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

His grades are failing, and his father \u2013 traditional and strict (but who must have also at some point gave in and allowed him to have a motorcycle) \u2013 is trying everything he can think of to get the kid to apply for college. His mother is so silent, she might as well not even exist. Really, his support system lies entirely in his twinkle-toed little sister, who's nosy but cheers him on in her own way.\n\nBobby really does little else but work on his bike. He cleans his bike. He tunes up his bike. He rides his bike. One would call him a motorcycle otaku. His most recent achievement seems to have been getting photos of himself on a road trip printed in a motorcyclist hobby magazine. This leads to an unexpected result: a girl his age, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A long, rambling letter, but dreamily romantic just the same. Bobby admits to his sister that he's never gotten a letter from a girl before. He writes back, \"I got your letter. I'm happy 'cause it was from a girl.\"\n\nBobby is not a well-rounded kid. He barely speaks \u2013 even to his own family \u2013 and the \"letters\" he writes back to the mystery girl usually consist of a single sentence or so. His obsession is all-consuming, to the point where he happily quits school to work at a biker bar. Of course, his father, at a loss, kicks him out of the house. Staying with a friend, he's delighted when his female pen pal says she'll call him. On that day, his boss at the bar decides to take him to a motocross track. But that's a day that wouldn't end in a way that anybody would expect.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)",

Apparently warriors coming from the west are involved, and the defeated all bore the markings of a sword brim on their bodies. Kan'u Unchou, a special A-rank, set out to investigate the enemies, but supposedly loses to them. Ekitoku suspects Kansai has people that are S-ranks, since this is the only way such a defeat could be explained. They then all plan to meet up with Chouun Shiryuu and Kan at a nearby temple, to ensure that there are no more victims, but things are starting to look very grim...\n\n(Source: foo2)",

Haru causes one headache after another, but when she snoops around in Eri's laptop and discovers that she is an online composer, Eri is furious. Haru, enamored by Eri's music, desperately wants to sing with Eri, but Eri is dead set against it. Will the two be able to find common ground?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The man introduces himself as God and apologizes for his mistake that resulted in her untimely demise, vowing to make it up to Kaoru by reincarnating her into another world. The next world's goddess, Celestine, reforms Kaoru's body and gives her all the concessions she asks for: the body she had when she was 15, the ability to make potions with effects of her choice, and a box with infinite storage space, to name a few.\n\nBut soon, Kaoru realizes that, despite being told otherwise, this new medieval world doesn't have much in the way of magic, causing her potions to be highly sought after by greedy nobles. However, by using knowledge from her previous life, she just might find a way to survive in this world using her potions. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The southern hemisphere is placed in another dimension while the inhabitants of the northern hemisphere are able to morph into beast-like humanoids. Eventually the humans of the southern hemisphere, led by Uranus, attack the Beasts.\n\nThe Three Beasts, Wan Derbard (Wan Dabadadatta) of the Tiger Tribe, Bud Mint (Baado Mint) of the Bird Tribe, and Mei Mer (Mei Mah) of the Mermaid Tribe, are taken prisoner along with Mei Mer's companion Tuttle Millen (Mekka Mannen, also of the Mermaid tribe), but manage to escape thanks to a little girl named Yuuni Charm Password. Together they seek Gaia, which they believe to be a fabulous treasure, but they are pursued by Uranus's minions : V-Darn the vicious mage-knight, V-Sion the warrior woman and Akumako, V-Darn's sadistic imp-like partner.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

        "synopsis": "Subaru Sumeragi is the thirteenth head of his powerful onmyouji clan. Until the time comes when he must succeed his grandmother fully, Subaru is allowed to live in Tokyo with his fraternal twin Hokuto. While Subaru is kind and shy, Hokuto has exuberance to spare, and her favorite pastime is designing bold matching outfits for the two of them to wear. Her next favorite thing to do is try to set up Subaru with their veterinarian friend Seishirou Sakurazuka who, oddly enough, is always readily available to accompany the Sumeragis throughout the city.\n\nSubaru has to resolve a variety of spiritual conflicts in Tokyo: some are cases formally brought to him by clients, and others are matters in which he decides to involve himself. A selfless teenager, he empathizes with others to the point that their pain may as well be his own. This leaves him vulnerable in a city where nearly everyone makes decisions that only benefit themselves as individuals. Hokuto hopes that if Subaru develops feelings for Seishirou, their relationship will be the one thing that he never gives up for the sake of anyone else. However, is Seishirou the best candidate for her brother's love, or is he hiding sinister secrets?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At this moment in time, the city is a mixture of extremes... past and present, rich and poor, good and bad. This is a city where we see both horsecarts and motorcars, swords and pistols, lords and businessmen.  \n\nA wealthy woman from an upper-class family finds herself attracted to a handsome young man, Taka. He and his younger brother seem to be allied, perhaps not entirely willingly, with some of the city's criminal underground (Yakuza). The lady's lovely young maidservant, Sara, meets him too, and a conflict ensues which can only lead to tragedy, passion, and dishonor.

While finding his own way to shine in the sport, Ryouma investigates a perplexing development: the circumstances behind his father's retirement from professional tennis. \n\nKnown as \"Samurai Nanjiro,\" Ryouma's father Nanjiro is a legendary tennis player whose career abruptly ended after the US Open finals several years prior. Though Ryouma has studied the final match extensively, there are still many gaps in his understanding\u2014gaps that he would only be able to fill by watching the match in person. \n\nAs luck would have it, a supernatural phenomenon transports the young prodigy\u2014and his unsuspecting classmate, Sakuno Ryuzaki\u2014back in time to that very event. Although the events that occur before the game seem normal at first glance, the appearance of the mafia soon complicates the mystery behind the retirement. Despite the bad odds, Ryouma must do everything he can to unravel the circumstances and prevent his father's career from ending.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On the case they find a woman who is abnormally hot, and who is being chased by a bunch of women with guns. After being dubbed Sara, the detectives try and figure out just what is going on with her.

Justin managed to sneak up on the two before the rain started pouring, forcing them to run for cover. They would eventually find a house in the wooded area, previously unseen according to Justin. At first glance it appeared nobody was home after entering the house, until they discovered a robot named Solar Ion Robot (Kadenchin), or the acronym SIR. They would soon meet the owner of the house, Professor Humphrey Bumble (Dr. Tokio Taimu), who introduced the children to his greatest creation, a time machine. Professor Bumble's attempt at recreating Benjamin Franklin's famous lightning experiment with the use of a kite flying outside the house to get the machine working only led up to SIR's temporary change in personality before sending the entire house on course for the past. \n\nThe children never realized how long the journey back home would be due to Professor Bumble's misguidance and errors in time travel, but in the meantime they witnessed and participated (with little or no consequences) in numerous events in the Bible's New Testament, from John the Baptist's birth to the rise of the Apostle Paul.\"\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Ten years in the making and entirely, single-handedly rendered in colored pencil, Kurosaka's fantastical labor of love is a marvel to behold. Emerging from the staggering detail and craft flooding every frame is the story of a young woman who sets out to engineer a dream-food that can put an end to the world's famine. Synthesizing Frederic Back's subtle, haptic textures with Bill Plympton's frenetic mutations and David Lynch's haunting wormholes, Kurosaka\u2019s work still retains its own singular, luminous potency.\n\n(Source: Los Angeles Animation Festival summary)",
