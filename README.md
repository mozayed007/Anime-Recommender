# Anime Recommender
## Project Overview
Anime Recommender is an open-source project that uses the MyAnimeList API v2 database to build a recommendation system. Through the use of categorical and numerical features for a machine learning model recommender, content-based filtering, and NLP semantic similarity techniques for synopsis and anime descriptions, this project helps users discover new anime that align with their tastes.
